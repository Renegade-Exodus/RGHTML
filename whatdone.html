<h1 id="1.35"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v1.35/DOS ]----</h1></b>
<br>

Miscellaneous Code clean up.<br>
<br>
New Menu CMDKEY, HQ  Hangs up User and quits the BBS to DOS.<br>
<br>
New Menu CMDKEY, HD  Displays GOODBYE.ANS/.ASC to the user<br>
upon slow logoff as before without the YES/NO Lightbar prompt<br>
being used.<br>
<br>
 ■   New Menu CMDKEY, 1E  Edit Oneliners.  This will allow you to<br>
  edit or remove onleiners you do not approve of on your BBS.<br>
<br>
 ■   Miscellaneous Color Fixes within some prompts.<br>
<br>
 ■   Updated miscellaneous bullet character "■" infront of titles and<br>
  information after downloads finish to quit changing to a ? each<br>
  time the source was compiled. :)<br>
<br>
 ■   Updated File Description Search functions to log what user was<br>
  searching for in the SYSOP.LOG file.<br>
<br>
 ■   New Menu CMDKEY, DX  Output ALL Door Files at the same time.<br>
  Useful when running a program that uses one and spawns into<br>
  another program that only works with different drop file in the<br>
  same batch file.<br>
<br>
 ■   Found and FINALLY killed bug that causes NTVDM crashes when using<br>
  any program that used the ComPort directly.<br>
<br>
 ■   New Renegade starting parameter, -K  causes Renegade to drop to<br>
  DOS on all disconnects from the BBS.  Useful if you are using RG<br>
  as a door server.  Updated Renegade -? Help screen to<br>
  reflect this.  This will act the same as -T except it will drop<br>
  to DOS and not the WFC screen.<br>
<br>
 ■   _MORE_ Color Fixes within some prompts.<br>
<br>
 ■   Updated Netmail area internal display prompts and procedures.<br>
<br>
 ■   Updated & Bullet proofed Renemail thanks to Nick Andre.<br>
<br>
 ■   Renemail new option, -X  which will pull messages from <br>
  Renegade's data files and converts it back to *.MSGs for those<br>
  wanting to do %RESCAN and pickup past messages.<br>
<br>
 ■   New Renegade starting parameter, -R  causes Renegade to update<br>
  the MULTNODE.DAT file with any information you want from the command<br>
  prompt.<br>
<br>
 ■      Usage: Renegade -R [Node number] [ON or OFF] [Username w/NO spaces]<br>
            [Activity]<br>
<br>
     Renegade -R 5 ON D'Bridge Tossing Mail<br>
     Will update Node 5 to say D'Bridge and status of Tossing Mail<br>
<br>
     Renegade -R 5 OFF<br>
     This would clear the node status of node 5.<br>
<br>
 ■   Removed some old Error Logging to the file areas.<br>

 ============================================================================
			<br/>
                    U - Updated     A - Added     F - Fixed
			<br/>
 ============================================================================
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>

     F.  Fixed bug where new ONELINERS would not display if a
			<br/>
         datafile was remade from scratch and there were not a
			<br/>
         total of 10 ONELINERS present in the original data file.
			<br/>
         Before you would have to save 10 entries to the ONELINER
			<br/>
         before anything would start to display.  This has now
			<br/>
         been corrected.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Renegade no longer sets the USERNAME as a blank field if
			<br/>
         you were to hit ENTER when trying to change your username
			<br/>
         on the BBS.  New RGLNG.TXT entry has been added to account
			<br/>
         for this as well.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Strings added to RGLNG for the "Scanning for your new
			<br/>
         mail." and other strings related to this.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  User Editor now uses standard prompts for editing
			<br/>
         instead of using any pre-defined strings made in RGLNG that
			<br/>
         were intended for the NEWUSER INFO MENU & PERSONAL MENU.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  SysOp Window toggle back at ALT-S since SysOp Split
			<br/>
         Screen chat is now a toggle in the system config.  ALT-A
			<br/>
         still works as well for now.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Added %EP (Empty Pause) MCI Code.  This is for SysOps
			<br/>
         or users that want to make their own PAUSE prompt without
			<br/>
         using the system deinfed one.  Just write your Pause Prompt
			<br/>
         and on the next line input the MCI Code %EP.  (Work in
			<br/>
         progress.)

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  SysOp Password prompt will no longer have an input
			<br/>
         field as part of the string.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Color codes right before the @ sign was not displaying for
			<br/>
         Logon and Password strings.  This has now been corrected.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Renegade will no longer prompt to save a blank string.
			<br/>
         It will now revert to the string before the change was made.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Scrolling Text File Viewer.  Work in progress, but it's
			<br/>
         a start and it works.  Right now, ASCII text only works.  Will
			<br/>
         add more complex features as we work on this.

			<br/>
			<br/>
         New MENUCMD:    VI - Scrolling Text File Viewer

			<br/>
			<br/>
         Works the same as -F.  Whatever you put in the options field
			<br/>
         will be displayed, only with the VI CMD Key you can scroll
			<br/>
         UP and DOWN.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Bug in Renemail which would cause a large swap file
			<br/>
         to be created if a certain type of Fido stye message was
			<br/>
         imported.  This has now been corrected and checked for.
			<br/>
			<br/>

     A.  More Strings external.  SysOp In/Out and Multinode
			<br/>
         chat availble/unavailable.
			<br/>

     F.  Oneliners will now show [ANONYMOUS] if the person
			<br/>
         who wrote the oneliner is deleted from the userbase.
			<br/>

     F.  Miscellaneous Cleanup and Color fixes.

============================================================================
			<br/>
                    U - Updated     A - Added     F - Fixed
			<br/>
 ============================================================================
			<br/>
			<br/>
    A.  Not really a Renegade Fix, but added Lee Woodridge to the
			<br/>
        Renegade Development Team.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    A.  Added internal OneLiner Program.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        New Files :
			<br/>
			<br/>
          ONELH.* - Oneliners Header (Optional)
			<br/>
          ONELM.* - Oneliners Middle (Required!!)
			<br/>
          ONELT.* - Oneliners Footer (Optional)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        ONELM.* MCI Codes :
			<br/>
			<br/>
         ~AN (Anon - Yes/No)           ~AT (Anon - True/False)
			<br/>
         ~DA (Date Added)              ~OL (The Oneliner)
			<br/>
         ~RN (Record Number)           ~U# (User ID with '#')
			<br/>
         ~U1 (User ID without '#')     ~UN (User Name)
			<br/>
         ~UL (User Name Lowercase)
			<br/>
         ~US (First 2 Letters of Username - iNiQUiTY Style)
			<br/>
         ~UU (First 2 letters of username lowercase)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        New MENUCMD Keys For OneLiners:
			<br/>
			<br/>
            1L - Display Oneliner (Header/Footer & all Oneliners)
			<br/>
			<br/>
            1R - Display Random line from Oneliner File
			<br/>
			<br/>
    F.  Local file upload bug.  Before when uploading locally with
			<br/>
        the FU command key after 1 upload it would stop and you would
			<br/>
        have to repeat the process.  It somehow become broken over
			<br/>
        the years and no one said anything.   Now it will upload all
			<br/>
        files without stopping if a *.* is entered for the filename.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    F.  When a file was moved, if it was a dupe, the file wasn't moved
			<br/>
        but the description was.  This is no longer the case.  If the
			<br/>
        file is a dupe, nothing is moved.  This prevents dupe file
			<br/>
        descriptions.  
			<br/>
			<br/>
    F.  The (~TO) MCI Code in the LASTM.ASC file would display a random
			<br/>
        number when viewed while the user was still online.  This has
			<br/>
        now been updated to show " - " until the user logs off and
			<br/>
        the correct time online will be shown by this MCI code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    A.  New MCI Code - %XYaa;bb% (aa=01-80 Left to right) and
			<br/>
        (bb=01-25 Top to Bottom).  Allows format positioning of the
			<br/>
        cursor without the need of having your ANSI menu file do it,
			<br/>
        for you.  Say you wanted the word "Hello!" to appear in the
			<br/>
        middle of the screen, it would be used as such:
			<br/>
			<br/>
            %XY40;12%Hello!
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The above would move the cursor to space 40, line 12, and put
			<br/>
        your text of "Hello!" starting there.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    U.  The Auto Message is now configurable.  It is like the oneliner,
			<br/>
        last caller, user list, etc.   It has a header, main, and a
			<br/>
        footer file in the MISC directory.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The auto message is now saved as "AUTOM.ASC" instead of
			<br/>
        "AUTO.ASC" to make it conform to the rest of the code base.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        New Files :
			<br/>
			<br/>
          AUTOH.* - Auto Message Header (Optional)
			<br/>
          AUTOM.* - (Can be made, but automagically made when a auto)
			<br/>
                    (message is created.  This is your auto message.)
			<br/>
          AUTOT.* - Auto Message Footer (Optional)
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Disabled Forgot password response for Co-SyOp and above.
			<br/>
         This would prevent someone from trying to logon as the SysOp
			<br/>
         and trying the forgot password question answer and resetting
			<br/>
         it so they can logon as the SysOp.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Can now scroll through the node settings without having to
			<br/>
         load each node seperately.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Added System Config Menu Option (N). SysOp Macros.  They were
			<br/>
         moved from another submenu to make a more cleaner look and easier
			<br/>
         to find.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Removed System Config and File Area Editors strings from
			<br/>
         the language files to prevent unwanted access.  Also removed the
			<br/>
         MCI codes that ran these menus (which would've caused a problem
			<br/>
         in certain instances.)
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  YES/NO LightBar Choice options added to the YES/NO Prompt MENUCMDs.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Split Screen Chat now auto scrolls and stays within it's
			<br/>
         borders.  Also added help commands that are listed in the center
			<br/>
         of the chat screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  When the SysOp breaks into chat via a "Chat Page" with the
			<br/>
         SpaceBar the split screen chat will auto load.  Otherwise, the
			<br/>
         normal line chat will be used.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         Chat commands are as follows:
			<br/>
                 ALT-C - Line Chat      ALT-S - Split Screen Chat
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Teleconference strings are now located within the RGLNG
			<br/>
         text file instead of the Node setup options screen in the system
			<br/>
         configuration section.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  RENEGADE.EXE /? now shows what command line parameters are
			<br/>
         available to run along with a short message of what each does.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  All strings are now combined into RGLNG.TXT.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  New MENUCMD  *T  to toggle SysOp Chat Availability without
			<br/>
         the use of the SCROLL LOCK key.   Also, new MCI Code %SA to show
			<br/>
         if the sysop is avaliable or not.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Removed more strings from Renegade and added them to
			<br/>
         RGLNG.TXT for more editing for the SysOp.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Redid NewUser Toggle Questions Menu to add all toggles
			<br/>
         in one place.  Remember to clear your all of your toggles after
			<br/>
         you upgrade so the new changes will take effect.  Cmd Key of *
			<br/>
         will do this for you.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  User #0 (Default account) can now be cleared for all user
			<br/>
         options.  Cmd Key of $ will allow you to clear out which
			<br/>
         fields you want to be blank instead of having a "." or some
			<br/>
         random text in the user data file. This is also a good idea to
			<br/>
         do once you upgrade as the forgot password question more than
			<br/>
         likely has a space in it's field and more than likely won't
			<br/>
         work until you clear the prompt with the $ cmd key.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Updated OP Menu CMD options.  Be sure to change these in
			<br/>
         your NEWINFO menu and PERSONAL info menus or else what you
			<br/>
         have listed won't match what it does. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         New OP Menu CMD Options:
			<br/>
			<br/>
                1  Handle
			<br/>
                2  Real Name
			<br/>
                3  Country
			<br/>
                4  Address
			<br/>
                5  City, State
			<br/>

			<br/>
               11  SysOp Defined Question #2
			<br/>
               12  SysOp Defined Question #3
			<br/>
               13  Password
			<br/>
               14  Forgot Password Question Answer
			<br/>
               15  Terminal Emulation
			<br/>
               16  ANSI Color Toggle
			<br/>
               17  Color Scheme

			<br/>
               22  Expert Mode
			<br/>
               23  Lightbars Toggle
			<br/>
               24  Editor Toggle
			<br/>
               25  Mailbox Toggle
			<br/>
               26  QWK Configuration
			<br/>
               27  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
               28  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
               29  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
               30  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Updated SysOp LOG Output.  Now shows a bit more info on
			<br/>
         what the user was doing while online.  Such as what menus
			<br/>
         were accessed (along with menu titles & numbers) and a time
			<br/>
         stamp on when things were accessed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Finally tracked down bug that would lock up a newscan
			<br/>
         if you had more than 255 files in a base.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  New MCI Code %OL -- Light Bars On/Off.  This replaces
			<br/>
         the file and message light bar mci codes.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Fixed bug that allowed the user to Email deleted users.
			<br/>
         Co-SysOp and higher can still email (for what reason, testing?)
			<br/>
         deleted users.  A Prompt will ask if you wish to or not.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Added Several Email Error strings to RGLNG
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Top 10 Files Listing now asks if you would like to
			<br/>
         download one of these files from the menu.  If you select YES
			<br/>
         you will be given the option to download file 1-10.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  More strings added to RGLNG.TXT file to edit for your
			<br/>
         pleasure. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  User Record now correctly updates stats when a user
			<br/>
         dowloads or uploads a file.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Increased MAX system menus to 200 from 100.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Added additional Sub-Menus to System Toggles in
			<br/>
         System Config.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated Renegade Booting to now NOT show all the debug code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated WFC Screen and removed the "total space free" option as
			<br/>
    Pascal only reports up to 1.9 Gig.  Added Errors to Today's stats
			<br/>
    as well and moved all options down to give a beter uniform look.

			<br/>
         ALT-A is now SysOp line ON/OFF

			<br/>
			<br/>
    The above CTRL-HOME options were changed in v1.22 but the Help screen
			<br/>
    was never updated.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated some miscellaneous display files that were maybe not
			<br/>

			<br/>
    RENEGADE\MISC directory.

	MCI CODES
			<br/>
			<br/>
     %OF - Use File Light Bar (ON/OFF Answer)
			<br/>
     %OM - Use Message Light Bar (ON/OFF Answer)
			<br/>
     %ON - If Node Is Available For Chat (ON/OFF Answer)
			<br/>
     %OZ - User's Current Archive Format (Extention - ie: ZIP, ARJ, RAR)
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Removed/Added some line spacing after certain hard coded internal
			<br/>
    displays and prompts.  Gives things a cleaner look than being jumbled
			<br/>
    together when they are displayed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Code Cleanup on Renemail.  Nothing major, tweaked the UI a little and
			<br/>
    did a color change.  Couldn't stand that Blue Background anymore.
			<br/>
    Also updated the copyright notice.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. New Renegade BBS WWW Home - http://www.rgbbs.info
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Finally noticed the "New Scanning of Files" prompt was not exported
			<br/>
    to RGLNG.TXT.  Added this option, so you can now change your
			<br/>
    "Scanning File Base Name ... " prompt to more closely match your BBS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    Will include a new RGLNG.TXT file in the update, or you can just add
			<br/>
    the option to the end of your RGLNG.TXT file called NEW_FILE_SCANNING
			<br/>
			<br/>
    $New_File_Scanning
			<br/>
    %CLScanning ... [%FB - %HM]@
			<br/>
    $
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated RGLNG.EXE to allow for the new addition as well.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Tweaked Files.BBS importer in Renegade a bit for better dupe checking.
			<br/>
    The Files.BBS importer can be run by running RENEGADE -F at the prompt.

======================== UPGRADE INFO ===========================
			<br/>
=================================================================
			<br/>
       Unzip this upgrade package into your main Renegade
			<br/>
       directory.  Run RGUPDATE.EXE to update miscellaneous
			<br/>
       data files and RENEGADE.DAT file.  Once this is done,
			<br/>
       the file can be erased.
			<br/>
			<br/>
       This is a "HotFix" to solve the XMS not loaded problem
			<br/>
  **   that a new windows update caused.  This should fix
			<br/>
       all issues with Renegade not loading.

			<br/>
Remember to add the following switches to your command
			<br/>
line to load Renegade properly.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Also, if using WinXP check your _DEFAULT.PIF file in
			<br/>
your main Windows directory.  Make sure all memory
			<br/>
settings are set to AUTO instead of NONE, or else RG
			<br/>
may or may not load.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Loading "RENEGADE -D" will load Renegade with Overlays
			<br/>
writing to DISK until you fix the memory issue with
			<br/>
the .PIF file in WinXP.  Do NOT run Renegade like this
			<br/>
all the time or the program will run very slow compared
			<br/>
to how it is supposed to run in memory.   This is just
			<br/>
a quick "fix" to be able to load the BBS and make sure
			<br/>
everything is working if you are getting a "Memory
			<br/>
Error."

			<br/>
We have included TEXT.ZIP as defaults that are needed.  Make sure
			<br/>
you append these to any "custom" strings you have so you will have
			<br/>
all strings to date. These should be the ONLY files in your TEXT
			<br/>
directory if you choose to create a seperate directory for these files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Option 9. below should be changed in RGCFG.TXT to reflect the name
			<br/>
change from "RAM Drive/MulitNode Path" to "Strings/Text Directory".
			<br/>
You can keep the same path, but whatever the path is set in Option 9,
			<br/>
is where Renegade will look for ALL strings.

<h1 id="1.10"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v1.10/DOS ]----</h1></b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
1.  FIXED  -  Minor issue with log files.  Anytime a QWK was downloaded
			<br/>
              garbage was thrown to the log file.  This has been
			<br/>
              corrected and will now show correctly what was done.
			<br/>
			<br/>
2.  FIXED  -  Pressing "P" for Point entry in the file validation editor
			<br/>
              would go into a never ending loop if there were no
			<br/>
              un-validated files in a file area.
			<br/>
			<br/>
3.  FIXED  -  Pressing 
			<CR> in the file validation editor would exit
				<br/>
              the validation process rather then skip to the next file.
				<br/>
				<br/>
4.  CHANGE -  The file validation editor will now show the file areas
				<br/>
              being scanned just like other file search commands do.
				<br/>
				<br/>
5.  FIXED  -  The file area display header was off by one character.
				<br/>
				<br/>
6.  CHANGE -  In the past, the maximum number of file areas allowed
				<br/>
              was 2048 with compression turned on and 32767 with it
				<br/>
              turned off.  Renegade will now support 32767 file areas
				<br/>
              with compression on or off.
				<br/>
				<br/>
7.  CHANGE -  The file area listing will now display the file areas
				<br/>
              one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire list.
				<br/>
              The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from file
				<br/>
              area 1. Pressing 
				<CR> will now display the next page
					<br/>
              (it will also restart the listing from file area 1 when
					<br/>
              the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will exit
					<br/>
              the file area display. Previously, this procedure opened
					<br/>
              all 3 files associated to an area (*.DIR, *.EXT & *.SCN)
					<br/>
              to read file area scan flag. This process sould now be
					<br/>
              faster since it now only opens the *.SCN file.
					<br/>
					<br/>
8.  CHANGE -  The file area change listing will now display the file
					<br/>
              areas one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire
					<br/>
              list.  The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from
					<br/>
              file area 1. Pressing 
					<CR> will now display the next
						<br/>
              page (it will also restart the listing from file area 1
						<br/>
              when the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will
						<br/>
              exit the file area display. Entering an invalid file
						<br/>
              area will redisplay the current page.
						<br/>
						<br/>
9.  CHANGE -  The file area set scan listing will now display the file
						<br/>
              areas one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire
						<br/>
              list.  The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from
						<br/>
              file area 1. Pressing 
						<CR> will now display the next
							<br/>
              page (it will also restart the listing from file area 1
							<br/>
              when the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will
							<br/>
              exit the file area display. Previously, this procedure
							<br/>
              opened all 3 files associated to an area (*.DIR, *.EXT
							<br/>
              and *.SCN) to set the area scan on or off. This process
							<br/>
              should now be faster since it now only opens the *.SCN
							<br/>
              file.
							<br/>
							<br/>
              Also, this procedure will now only set the scan on file
							<br/>
              areas the user has access to. The file area scan char
							<br/>
              has been moved to the left of the file area number vice
							<br/>
              between it and the file area description.
							<br/>
							<br/>
9.  FIXED  -  The resolution of a GIF file was truncated by one
							<br/>
              character when viewing these files using the Achive
							<br/>
              View Command, fixed.  Also spruced up the entire
							<br/>
              display.  GIF files that are missing will now be
							<br/>
              displayed with a blinking red "< Missing GIF >".
							<br/>
              GIF files that are bad will now be displayed with a
							<br/>
              blinking red "< Bad GIF >".  Bad or missing GIF files
							<br/>
              are also now added to the SysOp Log. The first line
							<br/>
              of the file description has been reduced to 31 chars
							<br/>
              to allow for the maximum possible length of the GIF
							<br/>
              resolution.
							<br/>
							<br/>
  1.  The File Area Editor has made modified with the following:
							<br/>
							<br/>
      A. The file area listing will now display one page at a time
							<br/>
         verses scrolling to the prompt.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      B. The File Area Name can not be blank or the default of
							<br/><< New File Area >>.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      C. The File Area File Name can not be blank or the default of
							<br/>
         NEWAREA.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      D. The File Area Download Path can not be blank.

      F. The File Area Archive Type must be active.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      G. The File Area Comment Type must be active.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      H. Unused fields in the Insert/Modify command will now
							<br/>
         display *None*.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      I. The File Area Insert command will now display the file
							<br/>
         Area information for editing verses just inserting the
							<br/>
         new record and then requiring you to go to the modify
							<br/>
         command to edit. You will not be able to save the
							<br/>
         new file area until all of the above items are correct.
							<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
							<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new file area.  The
							<br/>
         download/upload directories and the data files will be
							<br/>
         auto-created after the new file area is saved.  The *.SCN
							<br/>
         file will also be updated for all users to scan this file
							<br/>
         area.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      J. The File Area Delete command will no longer prompt to
							<br/>
         delete the data files if the the file area name is being
							<br/>
         utilized by another file area.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      K. The File Area Modify command will auto-create the
							<br/>
         download/upload path and data files after editing or
							<br/>
         changing to another file area.  The *.SCN file will
							<br/>
         also be updated to ensure all users are toggled to
							<br/>
         scan this file area.  You will not be able to save the
							<br/>
         file area you are editing until all of the above items
							<br/>
         are correct. This command has also been modified
							<br/>
         to scan the user file for deleted users and to set the
							<br/>
         *.SCN file to allow new scan for the next user to utilize
							<br/>
         this file area.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      L. Other changes included added some missing help data for
							<br/>
         certain commands and color changes.
							<br/>
							<br/>
  2.  I recommend that you access the File Area Modify command
							<br/>
      once you have installed this update and toggle thru all
							<br/>
      file areas and make corrections to your file areas as they
							<br/>
      are presented to you.

							<br/>
							<br/>
  1. The message area display header was off by one character, fixed.

         be prompted to save or discard the new message area.  The
										<br/>
         message directory and the data files will be auto-created
										<br/>
         after the new message area is saved.  The *.SCN file will
										<br/>
         also be updated for all users to scan this file area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      I. The Message Area Delete command will no longer prompt to
										<br/>
         delete the data files if the message area file name is being
										<br/>
         utilized by another file area. This option has also been
										<br/>
         modified to prompt you to delete the message directory if it
										<br/>
         is not being utilized by another message area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      J. The Message Area Modify command will auto-create the
										<br/>
         message directory and data files after editing or
										<br/>
         changing to another file area.  The *.SCN file will
										<br/>
         also be updated to ensure all users are toggled to
										<br/>
         scan this message area.  You will not be able to save the
										<br/>
         message area you are editing until all of the above items
										<br/>
         are correct. This command has also been modified
										<br/>
         to scan the user file for deleted users and to set the
										<br/>
         *.SCN file to allow new scan for the next user to utilize
										<br/>
         this message area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      K. Other changes included added some missing help data for
										<br/>
         certain commands and color changes.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  4.  I recommend that you access the Message Area Modify command
										<br/>
      once you have installed this update and toggle thru all
										<br/>
      message areas and make corrections to your message areas as they
										<br/>
      are presented to you.
										<br/>
										<br/>
1.  The file/message area compression routines have been replaced
										<br/>
    completely. In the previous version the following variables,
										<br/>
    functions and procedures were utilized:
										<br/>
										<br/>
    VAR - "FileCompArray = ARRAY[0..4095] OF SET OF 0..7"
										<br/>
    VAR - "MsgCompArray = ARRAY[0..4095] OF SET OF 0..7"
										<br/>
    Procedure - "NewCompTables:
										<br/>
    Function - "CompFileArea(FArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "CompMsgArea(MArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "AFBase(FArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "AMBase(MArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
										<br/>
    The FileCompArray/MsgCompArray were previously updated by the
										<br/>
    NewCompTables Procedure.  The NewCompTables Procedure would
										<br/>
    simply read in all file/message areas and set a bit to on or off.
										<br/>
    The CompFileArea/CompMsgArea Functions would then display the proper
										<br/>
    File/Message area after counting from the first file/message area to
										<br/>
    the file/message area that needed to be displayed based on the user
										<br/>
    access and compression setting in System Configuration.  The
										<br/>
    AFBase/AMBase Functions were utilized to return the proper file/message
										<br/>
    area after counting from the first file/message area to the
										<br/>
    file/message area the user actually selected based on the user access
										<br/>
    and compression settings in System Confguration.
										<br/>
										<br/>
    As you can see from the above discription, this required alot of
										<br/>
    memory to maintain the FileCompArray/MsgCompArray.  It also required
										<br/>
    four functions for area number display and access. Not to mention
										<br/>
    that the real area number for both display and access had to be
										<br/>
    counted up to every time an area was displayed or accessed.
										<br/>
										<br/>
    The following varibales, functions and procedures are being
										<br/>
    utilized in this release:
										<br/>
										<br/>
    FILE - "FACT[Node].DAT" (Stored in the Node Temp Directory)
										<br/>
    FILE - "MACT[Node].DAT" (Stored in the Node Temp Directory)
										<br/>
    TYPE - "CompArrayType = ARRAY[0..1] OF INTEGER"
										<br/>
    VAR - "LowFileArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    VAR - "HighFileArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    VAR - "LowMsgArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    VAR - "HighMsgArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    Procedure - "NewCompTables"
										<br/>
    Function - "CompFileArea(FArea,ArrayNum: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "CompMsgArea(MArea,ArrayNum: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
										<br/>
    Two new files (FACT[Node].DAT/MACT[Node].DAT have been created and
										<br/>
    are temporarily stored in the Node temp directory.  A record of type
										<br/>
    ARRAY[0..1] OF Integer is the storage method utilized for the
										<br/>
    individual file areas.  ARRAY 0 is utilized for storage of the
										<br/>
    file/message area to display and ARRAY 1 is utilized for the storage
										<br/>
    of the file/message area being accessed. Each record takes up 2 bytes
										<br/>
    of space on your harddrive and the above file will only contain
										<br/>
    records for the actual number of message/file areas you actually have
										<br/>
    available. Both of these files are created at user logon and updated
										<br/>
    at other appropriate times as Renegade requires and then deleted when
										<br/>
    the user logs off.  The NewCompTables Procedure creates and updates
										<br/>
    the actual file/message area for display (ARRAY 0) and the actual
										<br/>
    file/message area to access (ARRAY 1).  This saves on the need to
										<br/>
    have the FileCompArray/MsgCompArray and the need for the
										<br/>
    CompFileArea/CompMsgArea And AFBase/AMBAse to count everytime
										<br/>
    from 1 to the file/message area displayed or accessed. The
										<br/>
    CompFileArea/CompMsgArea Functions have been modified to access the
										<br/>
    record contained in the FACT[Node].DAT/MACT[Node].DAT file for the
										<br/>
    file/message area being display/accessed.  This eliminated the need
										<br/>
    for the AFBase/AMBase Functions.  CompFileArea(FArea,0) or
										<br/>
    CompMsgArea(FArea,0) is called to obtained the display area number
										<br/>
    and CompFileArea(FArea,1) or CompMsgArea(FArea,1) is called for
										<br/>
    the area number to access.  NewCompTables will now also return the
										<br/>
    LowFileArea, HighFile, LowMsgArea & HighMsgArea for trapping correct
										<br/>
    or incorrect file/message area user input.
										<br/>
										<br/>
    As you can see, this enhancement saved alot of memory. Display and
										<br/>
    access to a file/message areas should now be faster.  Adding the
										<br/>
    low/high File/Messae variables will also help trap user input errors.
										<br/>
										<br/>

										<br/>
         command to edit. You will not be able to save the
										<br/>
         new conference until the item above is correct.
										<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
										<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new conference area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      D. The Conference Modify command will also require that the
										<br/>
         above item is correct before saving the record being edited.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  2.  I recommend that you access the Conference Modify command

         command to edit. You will not be able to save the
										<br/>
         new validation record until all of the above items are correct.
										<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
										<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new validation record.

      C. The Protocol Editor Insert/Modify option will display only
										<br/>
         the fields required for the type of protocol you are
										<br/>
         setting up.  This is controlled by the Single/Batch Flags and
										<br/>
         the UL/DL Commands.  Numerous notes and error messages have

										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
<h1 id="1.00"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v1.00/DOS ]----</h1></b>
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
1.  ADDED  -  Two new commands for the message read menu: (See Updated
										<br/>
              MENUCMD.ASC File)
										<br/>
										<br/>
                RS = Show Message Poster (User Information)
										<br/>
                RV = Validate Message Poster (Level A-Z)
										<br/>
										<br/>
                MR CMD now needs an option to read public messages
										<br/>
                This was update last version but wasn't documented
										<br/>
                properly.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                MR = Read Messages [Options - R]
										<br/>
										<br/>
                  R - Read Public Message Areas
										<br/>
										<br/>
                Leaving the options field blank will read E-Mail.
										<br/>
										<br/>
2.  FIXED  -  When editing a message in the public areas, pressing E
										<br/>
              for edit and then pressing D to display header only
										<br/>
              displayed up to 5 lines.  If the message was posted as
										<br/>
              anonymous, you wouldn't see the 6th line for the real
										<br/>
              name to whatever name.
										<br/>
										<br/>
3.  CHANGE -  Intergrating email read menus to work in the existing
										<br/>
              public message read menus.  And then in so doing the
										<br/>
              "Back In Thread" and "Forward in Thread" now also work
										<br/>
              when reading private messages.  So, in the end, the
										<br/>
              private mail read menus will use the same public read
										<br/>
              menus, have the same look and feel.
										<br/>
										<br/>
4.  FIXED  -  Cleaned up the Validate user from the ReadMail command,
										<br/>
              this command allowed pressing a "Q" to quit, but in
										<br/>
              doing so, you would validate the user at whatever
										<br/>
              level "Q" was.  This was removed and require just that
										<br/>
              ENTER be pressed to avoid setting anything.
										<br/>
										<br/>
5.  CHANGE -  The move command to work to move messages from the
										<br/>
              public message areas to the private (not sure when the
										<br/>
              need might arise to do this, but maybe a flame in the
										<br/>
              public area and the sysop wants to move it to private
										<br/>
              if the receiver is a member of the bbs, rather then
										<br/>
              just delete it).
										<br/>
										<br/>
6.  CHANGE -  The messages are now listed before selecting a message.
										<br/>
              Before, all you got was a prompt that said what area
										<br/>
              you were in and the range of the messages to select from.
										<br/>
              Now, when reading all private mail or public mail, The
										<br/>
              messages are listed (With header) up to 18 messages per
										<br/>
              page.  Pressing enter takes you to the next page or 
										<br/>
              listing of messages.  Once you reached the end of the
										<br/>
              messages (by pressing ENTER) and you press it again, it
										<br/>
              will take you back to the first message and you can
										<br/>
              continue to list messages that way until you select
										<br/>
              one or quit.
										<br/>
										<br/>
7.  FIXED  -  The creation of VDM*.TMP files in Windows XP caused by
										<br/>
              Renegade are now fixed.  These files should NO LONGER
										<br/>
              be created because of file locking issues with Renegade.
										<br/>
              It took a while to fix, but ... it's windows, yaknow. ;)
										<br/>
										<br/>
8.  ADDED  -  Added a new MENUCMD Key : 
										<br/>
										<br/>
              RJ  -  Forward Public Message into Private Mail and
										<br/>
                     also Private E-Mail to another Private E-Mail
										<br/>
                     account.
										<br/>
										<br/>
              This CMD Key is for the READP Menu ONLY to FORWARD a
										<br/>
              public message to private e-mail.
										<br/>
										<br/>
9.  CHANGE  - The High Read Msg Pointers are no longer updated after
										<br/>
              a new account is created.  This was taking a very long
										<br/>
              time if a BBS had a large amount of messgae areas. This
										<br/>
              is now done the first time the user scans the msg areas.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
10.  FIXED  - A bug where if the sysop shells inside a background input
										<br/>
              prompt (Blue for example) the screen will no longer turn
										<br/>
              the color of the input box in the shell.  It will clear
										<br/>
              the screen using a black background, lightgrey foreground.
										<br/>
										<br/>
11.  FIXED  - RG would attempt to create the entire directory (Example:
										<br/>
              C:\rg\dls\test).  If dls didn't exist before the "test",
										<br/>
              it would fail.  Now, it will create the entire directory
										<br/>
              (if the path is valid).  It now also reports errors to the 
										<br/>
              user on screen.
										<br/>
										<br/>
12.  CHANGE - You can now use a "D" to make the ULPath the same as the
										<br/>
              DLPath instead of typing in the entire path if they are
										<br/>
              the same when creating a new file area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
13.  CHANGE - New History Editor - You can now edit dates and information
										<br/>
              inside the HISTORY.DAT file to correct any errors that
										<br/>
              are noticed.   You can now view logons by BAUD RATE via the
										<br/>
              history editor.
										<br/>
										<br/>
14.  FIXED  - Numerous updates to all the door drop files (ongoing).
										<br/>
										<br/>
15.  CHANGE - Updated "RENEGADE.LNG" file, and new converter "RGLNG.EXE"
										<br/>
              which compiles the few remaining strings and removes all
										<br/>
              strings that were moved to differnt files and locations
										<br/>
              on previous versions.
										<br/>
										<br/>
16.  CHANGE - FILE_ID.DIZ File Descriptions are now expanded to 99 lines.
										<br/>
              All you ASCII Art Freaks should scream "Hor-ray!"
										<br/>
										<br/>
17.  FIXED  - Time Slice Routines - RG now actually detects if it is
										<br/>
              running under DOS, OS2 or Win32 and act accordingly.  Before
										<br/>
              Renegade ALWAYS thought it was under DOS and thus caused
										<br/>
              some slow down which was sort of addressed with the time
										<br/>
              slice setting in system config.  This will help even more
										<br/>
              now that it is hardcoded to look for this.
										<br/>
										<br/>
18. OLD/NEW - MENUCMD  *=  This allows Renegade to display long or short
										<br/>
              menu cmd listings.  *= with options set at 1 will display
										<br/>
              short menu cmds.  *= with options set at 2 will display
										<br/>
              long menu cmds to the screen.
										<br/>
										<br/>
19.  FIXED  - "FC" CMD KEY (Files.BBS Importer)
										<br/>
										<br/>
               1.  Optimized by removing a duplicate procedure.
										<br/>
               2.  Reports duplicate files in the Sysop.log.
										<br/>
               3.  Reports missing files in the Sysop.log.
										<br/>
               4.  The "Hatched" flag is now set for all imported files.
										<br/>
               5.  The user can now enter file points per file uploaded
										<br/>
                   when not in the waiting for caller screen (Parameter
										<br/>
                   switch -F).
										<br/>
               6.  All User/System upload statistics are checked for
										<br/>
                   variable overrun.
										<br/>
               7.  FILE_ID.DIZ will only be checked if allowed by
										<br/>
                   System Config setting.
										<br/>
										<br/>
20.  FIXED  - "*1" CMD KEY (Edit Files)
										<br/>
										<br/>
               1.  File name change will no longer allow renaming a
										<br/>
                   file if the new file names exists in the upload or
										<br/>
                   download path.
										<br/>
               2.  The Filesize limit as been increased to allow for
										<br/>
                   a maximum of 1.9 Gigs.  You now also have the choice
										<br/>
                   of updating with the actual file size or entering
										<br/>
                   whatever you like up to the 1.9 Gig limit.
										<br/>
               3.  You may now interactively edit the file description.
										<br/>
               4.  Changing the user name or number now reports an error
										<br/>
                   if the user does not exist.
										<br/>
               5.  Changing the upload date of the file will not allow
										<br/>
                   entry of a date beyond the current date.
										<br/>
               6.  The number of downloads has been increased to allow
										<br/>
                   up to 2147483647.
										<br/>
               7.  The modify extended description option has been
										<br/>
                   revamped.  If one exists, you will first be asked if
										<br/>
                   you would like to delete it, if one doesn't, you will
										<br/>
                   be asked if you would like to create one.  If you
										<br/>
                   decide to keep the exisiting one or created one,
										<br/>
                   you will be taken to the standard full screen message
										<br/>
                   editor, the old line by line edit mode has been
										<br/>
                   removed.  Existing extended descriptions will be
										<br/>
                   copied into the message editor for editing.  All
										<br/>
                   message editing option are available for line edit
										<br/>
                   or full screen edit mode.
										<br/>
               8.  The file move cmd has been revamped provides clearer
										<br/>
                   error message.
										<br/>
               9.  The User Editor option will now display messages if
										<br/>
                   the user doesn't meet the access requirement and
										<br/>
                   also default to User #1 if the current owner of the
										<br/>
                   file has been deleted.
										<br/>
              10.  All User/System upload statistics are checked for
										<br/>
                   variable overrun.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                                        - NOTE -
										<br/>
										<br/>
               A.  While editing the file owner name, the owner name
										<br/>
                   will be checked against the user name stored in
										<br/>
                   the user editor.  If the names do not match, the
										<br/>
                   file owner name will be converted to the Sysop name
										<br/>
                   (User #1).  The editor will assume that the orignal
										<br/>
                   uploader account has been deleted.
										<br/>
										<br/>
               B.  While updating the file size, if the file does not
										<br/>
                   exist, you will be asked if you would like to set
										<br/>
                   the file to offline or request status.
										<br/>
										<br/>
               C.  Use File_ID.DIZ must now be turn on in System
										<br/>
                   Config to be able to update or upload the Extended
										<br/>
                   Description (if it exists).
										<br/>
										<br/>
               D.  The internal archive viewer will now only attempt
										<br/>
                   to display files with the following extentions
										<br/>
                   (ZIP,ARC,PAK,ZOO,LZH,ARK,ARJ). IF the extention is
										<br/>
                   valid and the file doesn't exist, you will be
										<br/>
                   prompted to set the file to offline or to request
										<br/>
                   status.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
21.  CHANGE - FILE_ID.DIZ File Descriptions are now extended to 99 lines
										<br/>
              of text per file.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                NOTE:
										<br/>
										<br/>
                  The way extended description were handled has
										<br/>
                  been revamped.  Prior to this release, every
										<br/>
                  extended description required 950 bytes of
										<br/>
                  hard drive space rather the description required
										<br/>
                  it or not and was limited to 19 lines.  This
										<br/>
                  version now allows up to 99 lines of 50 chars
										<br/>
                  each and will only require space for the actual
										<br/>
                  characters utilized plus one byte for every line
										<br/>
                  in the description. For example: "This is a great
										<br/>
                  file" would only require 20 + 1 byte or 21 bytes
										<br/>
                  of harddrive space verses the old minimum of
										<br/>
                  950 bytes.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
22.  ADDED  - "OB" CMD KEY (User Statistics)
										<br/>
										<br/>
                1.  Renegade now has built in User Top 10 Statistics.
										<br/>
                    I recommend that a new menu be created for these
										<br/>
                    cmds.  Menu options are listed below along with
										<br/>
                    the title of the action performed.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                2.  Adding ;## will not allow that specific user to
										<br/>
                    be included in the stats file.  Example:  A;1
										<br/>
                    would not all User #1 to be posted in the current
										<br/>
                    stats screen.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                          Option     Top 10 Result
										<br/>
										<br/>
                             A         High Time Users
										<br/>
                             B         File Kbyte Uploaders
										<br/>
                             C         File Kbyte Downloaders
										<br/>
                             D         Private Message Senders
										<br/>
                             E         Public Message Posters
										<br/>
                             F         SysOp Feedback Senders
										<br/>
                             G         All Time Callers
										<br/>
                             H         File Uploaders
										<br/>
                             I         File Downloaders
										<br/>
                             J         File Points
										<br/>
                             K         Upload/Download Ratios
										<br/>
                             L         Post/Call Ratios
										<br/>
                             M         Top Download Files
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
23.  ADDED  - "L7" CMD KEY (File Archive View Tagging)
										<br/>
										<br/>
              Used on FILEP menu to allow file tagging when
										<br/>
              viewing internal archives.  Sames some time from
										<br/>
              having to type out the full filename. ;)
										<br/>
										<br/>
24.  CHANGE - Added 2 60 character lines to voting editor.  This
										<br/>
              replaces the 1 line of 65 characters.  Now you have
										<br/>
              2 lines to ramble on about for your voting pleasure.
										<br/>
										<br/>
25.  CHANGE - Moved time bank options from the timebank menu to
										<br/>
              System Config, Option E, Cmds X, Y, and Z.  This
										<br/>
              involved Max Time, Max Withdrawl, Max Deposit.
										<br/>
										<br/>
              No longer do you have to list these options in the
										<br/>
              options field of each command as they are now hard
										<br/>
              coded into Renegade.
										<br/>
										<br/>
26.  FIXED  - The Color Codes of the SYSOP.LOG file, no longer
										<br/>
              bleed from line to line.  Now each line will have
										<br/>
              it's own apporiate color(s), if color for logfile
										<br/>
              is turned on in System Config.
										<br/>
										<br/>
27.  ADDED  - Option to Messagae Base Editor to Renumber the
										<br/>
              QWK Index.  This is inplace to ensure each base
										<br/>
              has it's own IDX # and there are no duplicates.
										<br/>
              This should really only be used if you are
										<br/>
              having issues with QWK, or if you don't do a
										<br/>
              lot of QWK, to renumber the QWK # to match the
										<br/>
              base position number in the editor.
										<br/>
										<br/>
28.  ADDED  - ALT-S while a user is online will now enter into a
										<br/>
              split screen chat mode session.  ALT-C still works
										<br/>
              the same as before in a line by line text mode
										<br/>
              chat session.
										<br/>
										<br/>
              ALT-S was previously (Turn SysOp Status Bar ON/OFF),
										<br/>
              this cmd has moved to ALT-A.
										<br/>
										<br/>
29.  CHANGE - Made RGLNG to compile all strings in one easy swoop.
										<br/>
              RENEGADE.LNG needs renamed to RGLNG.TXT for this to
										<br/>
              work tho.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
 ---------------------- READ BELOW FOR CHANGES!!! -------------------------
										<br/>
										<br/>
Validation System Changes:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  In order to save memory, the validation records were moved from
										<br/>
      the RENEGADE.DAT file to the new VALIDATE.DAT file. These records
										<br/>
      were previously stored as an array of 1 to 26 records taking up
										<br/>
      about 3484 bytes of memory when loaded. This array also limited
										<br/>
      the number of available validation records to a maximum of 26.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  2.  Removing the validation records from the array stored in memory
										<br/>
      also allowed for increasing the maximum allowed validation records
										<br/>
      from 26 to 94. Of course, this changed the range of validation keys
										<br/>
      from A-Z to !-~.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  3.  Since the old new user validation key was logically the letter "A"
										<br/>
      (Or first character in the set).  The '!' is now the first character
										<br/>
      in the set and became the new user validation key.  The code has been
										<br/>
      internally modified to accept this key as such.  So, if you are using
										<br/>
      the letter "A" in your scripts or for your auto-validation command,
										<br/>
      please change it to the "!".
										<br/>
										<br/>
  4.  The VALIDATE.DAT file is checked during boot-up for existance and
										<br/>
      to ensure that it contains at least the new user validation record.
										<br/>
      Available validation keys are also stored in memory for later use
										<br/>
      in the validation process.
										<br/>
										<br/>
Validation Editor:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  The Validation Editor has been completely re-written adding a record
										<br/>
      delete, insert and position function. The modify option has also been
										<br/>
      extensively modified.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  2.  The deletion function will not allow removal of the new user
										<br/>
      validation record. It will also not allow you to remove a validation
										<br/>
      key that is still attached as an expire to key for any users.  You
										<br/>
      must first delete the expire to key from all users prior to deleting
										<br/>
      the effected key from the validation editor. Deleting a key also
										<br/>
      removes it from memory and global use.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  3.  The insert function will allow adding any one of the possible 94
										<br/>
      validation keys if it does not already exist. Inserting a key adds
										<br/>
      it to memory and is also available for global use.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  4.  Changes to the modify option:
										<br/>
										<br/>
      A.  Added a header to the records list display.
										<br/>
      B.  Added the Validation key to the record.  This key can not be
										<br/>
          modified.
										<br/>
      C.  The validation key description can not be modified for the
										<br/>
          new user validation key.
										<br/>
      D.  Added a free form field that will be sent to the user as a
										<br/>
          short message at logon.  This field should be utilized to inform
										<br/>
          the user of the type of validation they received.
										<br/>
      E.  The SL can no longer be lower then the SL stored in the New User
										<br/>
          Record of the USERS.DAT file (Record 0).
										<br/>
      F.  The DSL can no longer be lower then the DSL stored in the New
										<br/>
          User Record of the USERS.DAT file (Record 0).
										<br/>
      G.  Combined the AR modification and AR upgrade option into one cmd.
										<br/>
      H.  Combined the AC modification and AC upgrade option into one cmd.
										<br/>
      I.  Added a field for file point entry (Not implimented).
										<br/>
      J.  Increased the allowable credits from 65535 to 2147483647.
										<br/>
      K.  Added menu display for the start menu option.
										<br/>
      L.  Combined the expiration days/expire to option in one command.
										<br/>
          Before, you could actually set one and not other.  Expiration
										<br/>
          days without an expire to key wouldn't do anything more then
										<br/>
          having an expire to key without expiration days. Setting a null
										<br/>
          value for one forces they other to a null value as well. You can
										<br/>
          not modify these fields for the new user validation record.  Why
										<br/>
          would you want to expire someone below your lowest value. Also,
										<br/>
          you will only be able to attach keys that actually exists. This
										<br/>
          Expire To key can not be the same as the validation key
										<br/>
          associated to the record you are currently modifying.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  5.  The position command works the same as it would in any other editor
										<br/>
      within renegade.
										<br/>
										<br/>
User Editor:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  Combined the expiration days/expire to option in one command.
										<br/>
      Before, you could actually set one and not other.  Expiration
										<br/>
      days without an expire to key wouldn't do anything more then
										<br/>
      having an expire to key without expiration days. Setting a null
										<br/>
      value for one forces they other to a null value as well. Also,
										<br/>
      you will only be able to attach keys that actually exists.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      NOTE: You must set both the expiration date and expire to key to
										<br/>
            null for every user it's attached to should you ever want to
										<br/>
            delete a validation key.
										<br/>
										<br/>
Auto-Validation Command:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  The menu option is checked for proper syntex 
										<password;Level>.
											<br/>
  2.  The level is checked to ensure it actually exists or logs an error.
											<br/>
  3.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
											<br/>
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
											<br/>
  4.  This command will exit and log an error if the "Expire To Level"
											<br/>
      does not exists.
											<br/>
  5.  This command will exit and log an error if a user attempts to
											<br/>
      validate themselves at the same access level (Checks SL/DSL/AR/AC).
											<br/>
  6.  This command will exit and log an error if a user attempts to
											<br/>
      validate themselves at a lower access level (Checks SL/DSL).
											<br/>
  7.  The password length is now set to a maximum of 20 characters.
											<br/>
  8.  Entry of the password is now masked.
											<br/>
  9.  Incorrect password entry exits and logs and error.
											<br/>
  10. If it exists, the file "AUTOVAL" is displayed upon sucessfull
											<br/>
      validation. Otherwise, the user message stored in the validation
											<br/>
      level is displayed.
											<br/>
  11. The sysop window message and sysop log entry has been changed to
											<br/>
      display either "himself" or "herself" (Depending on the user gender)
											<br/>
      and the auto-validation level.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Validation (Prompted):
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  The validation level selection prompt will only except entry of an
											<br/>
      existing level in the validation editor.
											<br/>
  2.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
											<br/>
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
											<br/>
  3.  This command will display a message if the "Expire To Level" does
											<br/>
      not exists.
											<br/>
  4.  This command will display a message to the user if an attempt is made
											<br/>
      to validate a user at the same access level (Checks SL/DSL/AR/AC).
											<br/>
  5.  This command will now display both the old a new settings when a
											<br/>
      validation key is selected and offer the user an option to continue
											<br/>
      with validation using the current level or select another level.
											<br/>
  6.  The user is now sent the short message stored in the validation level.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Validation (Internel):
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  The level is checked to ensure it actually exists or exits and logs
											<br/>
      an error.
											<br/>
  2.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
											<br/>
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
											<br/>
  3.  The "Expire To" level is checked to ensure it actually exists or the
											<br/>
      option exits and logs an error.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											<br/>
Conference System Changes:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  In order to save memory, the conference records were converted
											<br/>
      from loading as an array of records to load as a single record.
											<br/>
      These records were previously stored as an array of 1 to 27
											<br/>
      records taking up about 1674 bytes of memory when loaded.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  2.  The CONFRENC.DAT file is checked during boot-up for existance and
											<br/>
      to ensure that it contains at least the general conference record.
											<br/>
      Available conference keys are also stored in memory for later use
											<br/>
      in the conference system process.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Conference Editor:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  The Conference Editor has been completely re-written adding a record
											<br/>
      position function.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  2.  The deletion function will not allow removal of the general
											<br/>
      conference record. Deleting a conference will also convert the
											<br/>
      last conference a user was in to the general conference if it was
											<br/>
      the same conference being deleted. Deleting a key also removes it
											<br/>
      from memory and global use.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  3.  The insert function will allow adding any one of the possible 27
											<br/>
      conference records if it does not already exist. Inserting a key
											<br/>
      adds it to memory and is also available for global use.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  4.  Changes to the modify option:
											<br/>
											<br/>
      A.  Added the conference key to the record.  This key can not be
											<br/>
          modified.
											<br/>
      C.  The conference description can not be modified for the
											<br/>
          general conference.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  5.  The position command works the same as it would in any other editor
											<br/>
      within renegade.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Change Conference Command:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  Will now generate an error if the menu option is not an existing
											<br/>
      conference or '?'.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											<br/>
The following features have been added to RG:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  Added an option to toggle all AR flags "*".
											<br/>
  2.  Added a clear fields function. This feature can be accessed by pressing 
											<br/>
"$" in the user editor.  Any fields that are cleared will be re-asked of the 
											<br/>
user the next time they logon.  Handy for questionable entries in the user 
											<br/>
record.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Internal Message Editor Changes:
											<br/>
											<br/>
   1.  The total line counter was off by one, fixed.
											<br/>
											<br/>
   2.  The line editor was originally split into two separate sub menus.
											<br/>
       The first menu allowed for general adding of text and editing
											<br/>
       along with the importing of text files, attaching files, etc.
											<br/>
       If you wanted to edit a line, you had to exit to the second menu.
											<br/>
       This second menu also contained some commands that were duplicative
											<br/>
       from of first menu.  Now, these two menus have been combined
											<br/>
       into one menu.  All duplicative code has been removed.
											<br/>
											<br/>
   3.  A number of new user error messages have been added utilizing the
											<br/>
       color code  or Red.
											<br/>
											<br/>
   4.  Command changes:
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Abort -  Will now display an error message if the message can not
											<br/>
                be aborted.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Clear -  Will now display an error message if the message is empty.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Delete - Will now display an error message if the message is empty.
											<br/>
                This command will also display the deleted line and give
											<br/>
                you an option to continue or not with it's deletion.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       File Attach - Will now display an error message if the user does
											<br/>
                     not have file attach access.  The user is also
											<br/>
                     prompted as to rather they wish to proceed with
											<br/>
                     the file attachment or not.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Insert - Will now display an error message if the message is empty
											<br/>
                and when the user has reached the maximum lines allowed.
											<br/>
                The user will be prompted with the line number to insert
											<br/>
                and asked if they want to proceed with the line insertion.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       List   - Will now display an error message if the message is
											<br/>
                empty.  Will now ask the user if they want to list the
											<br/>
                entire message or allow the user to enter a starting
											<br/>
                line number. The listing "Pause" has been changed to
											<br/>
                the "Allow Continue" pause.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Dsiable MCI - Will now display an error message if the user does
											<br/>
                     not meet the access requirements.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Replace String - Will now display an error message if the message
											<br/>
                        is empty.  The user is prompted to continue or
											<br/>
                        not with the string replacemnt after editing.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Quote - Will display an error message if the user is not
											<br/>
               replying to a message.  Will also display an error
											<br/>
               message when the maximum lines are reached. Corrected
											<br/>
               the line number display (it would only justify up to
											<br/>
               2 char positions, will now adjust for 3).
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Delete Last Line - Will now display an error message if the
											<br/>
                          message is empty.  Will prompt the user to
											<br/>
                          continue or not with the last line deletion.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Save -  Will now delete any empty lines at the end of the message.
											<br/>
               Ever notice an empty saved message.  This was due to the
											<br/>
               fact that a user could just hit the space bar to save one
											<br/>
               line of the message.  Now, this line is checked for all
											<br/>
               spaces and not saved.  An error message is sent to a user
											<br/>
               that can not abort the message if the message contains no
											<br/>
               text.  A message can not be saved that contains no text
											<br/>
               (Or at least I hope I thought of everything).
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Title - An error message is sent to the user if they can not change
											<br/>
               the title.  This normally applies to non-abortable
											<br/>
               messages.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Upload - An error message is sent to the user if they have reached
											<br/>
                the maximum line limit.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Replace Line - An error message is sent to the user if the message
											<br/>
                      is empty.  The user is prompted to continue with
											<br/>
                      the line replacement or not.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											<CR> -  Will allow you to continue adding lines to the message or
												<br/>
               will display the PRHELP.ASC file after every 5 keypresses
												<br/>
               when the maximum lines have been reached.
												<br/>
												<br/>
       ? - Displays the new PRHELP.ASC file.
												<br/>
												<br/>
   5.  If the maximum lines have not be reached, pressing the enter key
												<br/>
       five times will display the following messages:
												<br/>
												<br/>
       "Enter "/?" on a blank line for help."
												<br/>
												<br/>
       The 5 proceeding blank lines will also be removed.  This is helpful
												<br/>
       for new users.
												<br/>
												<br/>
   6.  Discovered a maximum character per line difference between the
												<br/>
       Full Screen Editor and the Line Editor.  This error was actually
												<br/>
       with the char count in the Line Editor and has been corrected.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Additional Message Editor Changes:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Non-abortable message changes (New User, etc):
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A. File attachment not allowed - Attaching a file
												<br/>
         would change the original subject of the message.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      B. Title change not allowed - The original receiver and
												<br/>
         subject should remain the same.
												<br/>
												<br/>
         Note:  The user can not abort or save a message that
												<br/>
                contains no text.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  File attachment changes:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  In previous releases, a user with file attachment access
												<br/>
          was not warned if they tried to attach a file when a file
												<br/>
          was already attached. However, this basically allowed the
												<br/>
          user to swap out the file should they attach an incorrect
												<br/>
          file.  In this release, if a file is already attached, the
												<br/>
          attached file will be displayed and the user will be prompted
												<br/>
          to replace the file.  I took this a step further, a user may
												<br/>
          also want to remove the attached file all together.  Presently,
												<br/>
          there is no option for this without aborting the message.
												<br/>
          Therefore, an option has been added for removing the attached
												<br/>
          file.  In this case, the user is also prompted to change the
												<br/>
          message subject.  If the subject contains no text, removing
												<br/>
          the attached file is aborted.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  Error messages:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  I did not feel there was adequate messages to the user as to
												<br/>
          certain editor options.  So, this area has been greatly
												<br/>
          expanded.  For example: Pressing "C" to clear a message
												<br/>
          when the message contains no text, now informs the user of
												<br/>
          this situation rather then nothing at all.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  Empty messages:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  In an effort to reduce the possibilty of an empty message being
												<br/>
          saved, the following apply:
												<br/>
												<br/>
          1.  All null lines at the end of a message are deleted.
												<br/>
          2.  All lines at the end of a message containing nothing
												<br/>
              but spaces are deleted.
												<br/>
												<br/>
          NOTE:  Lines are reviewed in reverse order up to the first
												<br/>
                 line containing text. The user will not be able to
												<br/>
                 save the message unless it contains some kind of
												<br/>
                 text.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  Title change:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  In certain cases, changing the title would actually remove
												<br/>
          the subject of the message.  I believe this error has now
												<br/>
          been corrected.
												<br/>
												<br/>
1.  File Downloads -
												<br/>
												<br/>
    A.  If an actual protocol (Like ZModem) was the first protocol
												<br/>
        (or record zero), the downloaded file would not have the UL/DL
												<br/>
        ratio checked.  This was do to the ratio being set to look for
												<br/>
        protocol records from [1..200].  Also, the maximum protocols
												<br/>
        allowed at present is 120.  The above should have been [0..120]
												<br/>
        to be correct.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    B.  For the ratio check, the FindFirst procedure would look for the
												<br/>
        file on the harddrive even if the ratio didn't need to be checked.
												<br/>
        This procedure was moved to only get the filesize if the ratio
												<br/>
        needs to be checked.  
												<br/>
												<br/>
        NOTE:  The FindFirst procedure would allow searching of any type
												<br/>
        of file on the hardrive.  This has been changed to not allow
												<br/>
        searching of Directory, VolumnID, Hidden & SysFiles.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    C.  In the present version, duplicate files could be added to the
												<br/>
        batch download queue.  This alpha release no longer allows
												<br/>
        duplicate files in the queue.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    D.  Downloading any file locally would place an entry in
												<br/>
        the sysop.log that the DL was successfull, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    E.  Adding a file to the batch DL queue will no loner indicate in the
												<br/>
        sysop.log that the file was downloaded successfully.  Now, it
												<br/>
        will either indicate that the file was added to the batch queue or
												<br/>
        that an unlisted file was added to the batch queue.  Adding a file
												<br/>
        to the queue doesn't complete the DL.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    F.  The ASCII download of a file has been modified.  The allow
												<br/>
        continue prompt and a pause after the DL has been added.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
File download buf fixes/enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  The Star procedure would carry the last color to the next
												<br/>
      line, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  Downloading a file locally would increment various dl statistics,
												<br/>
      fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  Downloading an unlisted file locally will now prompt the sysop
												<br/>
      or user for a path to copy the file to (Like a regular download
												<br/>
      currently does).
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  The copy command for local downloads, local unlisted downloads
												<br/>
      and copy from CDRom now gives more detail as to the status of
												<br/>
      the copy both to the user and sysop.log.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  Viewing a text file will now indicate that it was viewed vice
												<br/>
      downloaded both to the user and sysop.log.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6.  Attemtping to view a text file that is missing will no longer
												<br/>
      increment the DL statistics.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7.  The system should no longer allow downloading or uploading of
												<br/>
      batch files locally.  It should also no longer increment DL/UL
												<br/>
      statistics for batch transfers.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  8.  The user record was saved everytime a file was selected for
												<br/>
      download even if the download was aborted or not completed,
												<br/>
      fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  9.  There was an error in the checking of DL codes against the
												<br/>
      returncode when downloading files.  The DL codes in the
												<br/>
      protocol record are currently strings.  This string was being
												<br/>
      converted to a numeric value internally even if it were empty.
												<br/>
      The string to numeric conversion routine would interpret this
												<br/>
      empty string as a value of zero.  Since the value for success
												<br/>
      was set to a zero also, the system would assume a successful
												<br/>
      result.  Now, if the DLCode is a null string, it is not compared
												<br/>
      against the return code.  You may now have to input a zero into
												<br/>
      one of the DLCodes in the protocol record for a proper comparison.
												<br/>
      This also applies to the ULCodes in the protocol record.
												<br/>
												<br/>
 10.  Removed an extra file area initialization procedure in the DLX
												<br/>
      procedure.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade enhancements/bug fix's:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Removed a duplicate procedure for crediting the uploader for a
												<br/>
      file that was downloaded by another user.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  During a batch download, if no DL/Temp log was specified in the
												<br/>
      protocol editor, the uploader did not receive credit for the
												<br/>
      download. Other system/user statistics were updated though,
												<br/>
      fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  The above credit procedure never worked anyway due to some
												<br/>
      calculation errors in the code, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  A message telling the user to enjoy the file was only displayed
												<br/>
      if the user was charged file points, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  Messages to the user and the sysop.log provide additonal
												<br/>
      information about the Single Download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade BBS Enhancements/Bug Fix's:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Before the posting of a message or uploading of a file
												<br/>
      (Batch/Single), the available drive space was checked to
												<br/>
      ensure adequate space exists according to the system setup.
												<br/>
      This section of the code was duplicated in 3 places.  I converted
												<br/>
      this section to a function reducing numerous lines of code and
												<br/>
      extra variabes whenever it was utilized in the code.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  The copy/move procedures are now combined into one function.
												<br/>
      Variables for failure, no space and success were required
												<br/>
      external to the procedures everytime they were called. Various
												<br/>
      messages to the user/sysop.log were also reported external
												<br/>
      to these procedures.  I also noticed that the move procedure
												<br/>
      called the copy procedure if renaming a file was not successfull.
												<br/>
      Now, no variables are required externally for the function and
												<br/>
      messages to the user/sysop.log are handled internally within
												<br/>
      the copy/move function.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  I noticed that a section of the code for executing file
												<br/>
      transfer's was duplicated in 4 places.  This has been moved to
												<br/>
      a single procedure reducing numerous lines of code and
												<br/>
      variables.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  I noticed that a section of the code for checking the return
												<br/>
      code on file transfer's was duplicated in 3 places.  This has
												<br/>
      been moved to a single procedure reducing numerous lines of code
												<br/>
      and variables.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  The FILES.BBS selected for download during a batch transfer by
												<br/>
      the user now contains this starting entry:
												<br/>
												<br/>
       "(BBS Name) Batch Download File Listing"
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Previously, unlisted files were not written to the above list.
												<br/>
      Now, they are with "[No Description Available]" as the description.
												<br/>
      Also, files in the batch download queue with a bad path download
												<br/>
      path will have "[Bad Download Path]" as the description. These
												<br/>
      additions help account for files selected for Batch DL by the
												<br/>
      user.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6.  The max dos character field in the protocol editor has now been
												<br/>
      limited to 127 characters (Was 255).  I always thought it was 128,
												<br/>
      however I couldn't type in any more then 127 characters on the
												<br/>
      command line in DOS. Please feel free to check this out for
												<br/>
      yoursele and change you editor accordingly.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7.  Removed spaces from the file name written to the protocol file
												<br/>
      list for batch downloads.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  8.  The procedure that reads the success/failure codes and file name
												<br/>
      from the protocol temp log has been modified.  The starting
												<br/>
      position of the code and file name is specified in the protocol
												<br/>
      editor.  Assumming you set this up correctly, the success/failure
												<br/>
      code and the filename are copied to temporary strings. The success
												<br/>
      code is compared against the returncode from dos for single
												<br/>
      download/upload protocols or the DLCode specified in the protocol
												<br/>
      editor for batch downloads and the temp log.  This code is not
												<br/>
      utilized for batch uploads, the file is simply checked for existance.
												<br/>
      The temporary file name is compared against the batch queue for
												<br/>
      existance.  Since different protocol programs like dsz, etc utilize
												<br/>
      different log formats, it's impossible to tell the actual length of
												<br/>
      the success code or filename read from the temp log.  RG would simply
												<br/>
      read each string from the starting position and then chop off any
												<br/>
      trailing spaces and compared them as per above.  However, with ZM
												<br/>
      protocol, the file name ends with ",".  Therefore, I changed the
												<br/>
      comparison to look for the success code/filename to a String POS
												<br/>
      procedure rather then String = String.  In local tests (Both Single
												<br/>
      and Batch) it seemed to work without issue, we will see? The way it
												<br/>
      was handled before did not work with ZM protocol.  Hopefully, this
												<br/>
      solves it for all others (assuming you set things up correctly in the
												<br/>
      protocol editor.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Here's a few things I learned about protocols while editing the
												<br/>
      RG code:
												<br/>
												<br/>
        1.  If you set the option "Codes mean" in the protocol editor
												<br/>
            to "Transfer Successfull", you must specify a return dlcode
												<br/>
            and or ulcode for single protocols of zero.  Zero is hard
												<br/>
            coded into the procedure that executes the protocol.  A
												<br/>
            return code of zero from DOS indicates a successfull result.
												<br/>
            Of course, you could also reverse the above and specify
												<br/>
            "Codes mean" as "Transfer Failed" and specify all possible
												<br/>
            DLCodes/ULCodes as something other then zero.
												<br/>
												<br/>
        2.  If you do not specify a temp log for batch downloads, no
												<br/>
            error checking occurs within RG.  RG assumes the files were
												<br/>
            downloaded and increments statistics, etc.  RG does not create
												<br/>
            the temp log, you must add it to the DL/UL command line. You
												<br/>
            must also specify the proper file name and status starting
												<br/>
            positions within the log for RG to locate them.  Please
												<br/>
            read the protocol document for a description of the log
												<br/>
            entries and then count out the status & filename positions
												<br/>
            for the protocol editor.
												<br/>
												<br/>
            Here's what you need for the ZM protocol:
												<br/>
												<br/>
              1. Specify a Temp Log.
												<br/>
              2. Add -lz%L to the DL/UL Command Line to create a ZM
												<br/>
                 style log.
												<br/>
              3. Set "Codes mean" to "Transfer Successfull".
												<br/>
              4. Set DL/UL Code 1 as Z, Set DL/UL Code 2 as z.
												<br/>
              5. Set "File name" to 22.
												<br/>
              6. Set "Status" to 1.
												<br/>
												<br/>
              OR
												<br/>
												<br/>
              1. Specify a Temp Log.
												<br/>
              2. Add -ld%L to the DL/UL Command Line to create a DSZ
												<br/>
                 style log.
												<br/>
              3. Set "Codes mean" to "Transfer Successfull".
												<br/>
              4. Set DL/UL Code 1 as Z, Set DL/UL Code 2 as z.
												<br/>
              5. Set "File name" to 51.
												<br/>
              6. Set "Status" to 1.
												<br/>
												<br/>
        3.  The temp log is deleted by RG automatically, if you need
												<br/>
            or want a permanent log please specify a UL or DL Log.
												<br/>
												<br/>
            NOTE:  I realize some of you may know all there is to know
												<br/>
            about protocols and how they are handled by RG.  However,
												<br/>
            some do not.  Remember, if you do not specify all the above,
												<br/>
            your files will be transferred without error checking and
												<br/>
            statistics will not be updated.  Of course, you could forgo
												<br/>
            the above setup and RG will assume all files tranferred
												<br/>
            successfully.
												<br/>
												<br/>
        4.  Using the above setup may or may not work with currently
												<br/>
            released versions of RG or all external protocol programs.
												<br/>
												<br/>
Ok, one minor change, only use the lower case 'z' for the batch dlcode, not 
												<br/>
the upper case "Z".  The upper case 'Z" is for batch uploads and RG doesn't 
												<br/>
look at the ULCode for batch transfers.  Again, use the lower case 'Z" only 
												<br/>
for the batch dlcode.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade Bug Fix's/Enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Batch uploaded files would normally be moved to the file area
												<br/>
      selected by the user.  However, if the system was setup
												<br/>
      to utilize *.DIZ files and the uploaded file contained a *.DIZ,
												<br/>
      the file was moved to the current file area regardless of the
												<br/>
      area selected by the user, fixed!
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  Added a sysop.log entry to indicate that start and end of scanning
												<br/>
      the protocol temp log for downloaded files.  These entries were
												<br/>
      also added for the start and end scanning of the BATCHDL.DAT if the
												<br/>
      temp log is not being utilized.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  If the protocol temp log is being utilized, an entry was made to
												<br/>
      the sysop.log that the batch download failed.  This has been
												<br/>
      changed to indicate that the file or return code wasn't found.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Example SysOp.Log For Batch Downloaded Files:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      (If protocol temp log is utilized).
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Start scan of "BATCH6.LOG" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
      File not found: TEST.EXE
												<br/>
      Return code not found: FILELIST.EXE
												<br/>
      Batch downloaded: PKZIP.EXE
												<br/>
      End scan of "BATCH6.LOG" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      NOTE:  The above changes should assist in locating errors
												<br/>
      related to inproper protocol file name and status position
												<br/>
      configuration.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      (If protocol temp log is not utilized).
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Start scan of "BATCHDL.DAT" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
      Batch Downloaded: TEST.EXE
												<br/>
      Batch downloaded: FILELIST.EXE
												<br/>
      Batch downloaded: PKZIP.EXE
												<br/>
      End scan of "BATCHDL.DAT" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  If the user does not have enough time left online to complete
												<br/>
      a batch download they will be taken to the Batch DL Edit
												<br/>
      options (Clear, List & Remove).
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  If the filesize of an uploaded file were zero, the file would be
												<br/>
      awarded a file point, fixed (Example: OffLine Files).
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6.  If a file does not exist in the upload path during a local upload
												<br/>
      the user is prompted to make an offline entry. Previously a message
												<br/>
      was displayed before this question indicating that the file did
												<br/>
      not exist in the file directory.  This has been changed to indicate
												<br/>
      that the file does not exist in the upload path.  Also, there
												<br/>
      was no previous warning to the user that the file already exist in
												<br/>
      the file listing.  A message has now been added indicating that the
												<br/>
      file exists in the file listing. (Note: A duplicate entry will be
												<br/>
      added to the *.DIR file if the user selects "YES");
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7.  If a %F is utilized to pass the file name to DOS, it is checked to
												<br/>
      ensure it doesn't exceed the maximum DOS char length.  Only files
												<br/>
      up to this point are passed to DOS for processing, anything past
												<br/>
      this point in the Batch queue is not.  I added a sysop log entry
												<br/>
      for the first file in the queue that exceeds this length.  I did
												<br/>
      noticed that this process is only utilized for batch download
												<br/>
      transfers and may be required for the other transfer options.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  8.  Information about the name, size and download time are now
												<br/>
      displayed to the user about the Batch Download File Listing.  The
												<br/>
      total new download time is also displayed to the user.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  9.  The filesize was previously stored in the *.DIR file in 128 Byte
												<br/>
      blocks.  There was also a field used to store the remainder or
												<br/>
      bytes left over between 0-127.  This remainder was not fully
												<br/>
      implemented throughout the code to account for the total filesize.
												<br/>
      This impacted CPS rates and info displayed to the user about the real
												<br/>
      filesize and estimated download time.  I took a real hard look at
												<br/>
      this storage method and remembered that at one time, WWIV used this
												<br/>
      storage method for internal protocols.  Up till now, alot of extra
												<br/>
      code was required to convert the filesize to this dual storage
												<br/>
      method and alot was required to convert it back.  I saw no reason
												<br/>
      to continue this method.  Now, the filesize of a file contained
												<br/>
      in the *.DIR is stored as the actual filesize (LongInt Value).  All
												<br/>
      code related to this back and forth convertion has been removed.
												<br/>
      I provided an extra informational line for the 128/1024 block size
												<br/>
      that will be displayed when a file is selected for download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  10. The date was stored in the *.DIR file as both a longint value in
												<br/>
      seconds and the number of days since originally uploaded.  Once
												<br/>
      again, this required alot of extra code to convert back and forth
												<br/>
      and was only utilized in 2 places.  So, the number of days' since
												<br/>
      uploaded has been removed and is now calculated internally as
												<br/>
      needed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade Updates/Enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  ZM protocol will default to "/" vice "\" as directory path
												<br/>
      separators for *.log entries.  There is an option to convert
												<br/>
      this on the command line, however some sysops don't always read
												<br/>
      the documentation.  So, I added an internal conversion routine to
												<br/>
      look for this separator and automatically convert it.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  The message after adding a file to the batch download queue will now
												<br/>
      display the cumulative total of file points along with the number of
												<br/>
      files and download time.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  During a file download, the ratio of Uploads to Downloads is
												<br/>
      checked.  Although the ratio check of the total K bytes included
												<br/>
      the current file being downloaded, the ratio check of the total
												<br/>
      files did not include the current file being downloaded, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade Updates/Enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1. A file can no longer be copied onto itself or moved to the same
												<br/>
     directory it currently resides in.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2. In local mode, you must have CoSysOp access to move or copy an
												<br/>
     attached file or file selected for download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3. I noticed that download and upload statistics were displayed for
												<br/>
     batch transfers even if "Log-off after file transfer was selected",
												<br/>
     but not for single download or upload transfers, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4. Some items selected for download went thru the DLX procedure and
												<br/>
     some went directly to the send procedure.  Alot of extra code and
												<br/>
     variables were required for the send procedures everytime it was
												<br/>
     called.  Now, all download requests go thru the DLX procedure and
												<br/>
     then to the send procedure.  With this change, file downloading
												<br/>
     can be tracked for all downloads thru the same statistcal process.
												<br/>
     This includes, File attach, QWK, Unlisted and user archive.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5. All regular downloads were checked to ensure the user met all
												<br/>
     security requirements, ratio, etc prior to the download.  However,
												<br/>
     if a user was exempt from certain ratio checks, the user was
												<br/>
     charged anyway for the download unless the file area was marked
												<br/>
     as No-Ratio.  This applied to users flagged as No UL/DL Ratio in
												<br/>
     the User Record, No UL/DL Ratio in the System record, etc.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6. You will now be asked if the file exists on a CDROM for unlisted
												<br/>
     downloads.  This will alow for faster file transfers since the
												<br/>
     file is copied from the CDRom to the Temp Node Directory for
												<br/>
     download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7. The default file name for extracting text from a message has been
												<br/>
     changed from "MSG.TXT" to MSG
												<Node>.TXT.  Of course, you still
													<br/>
     have the option of changing this to whatever you like at the
													<br/>
     prompt.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8. For Offline mail transfers, the bbs will no longer attempt to copy
													<br/>
     the WELCOME, NEWS or GOODBYE file if they path to the file is
													<br/>
     blank.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
Renegade updates/enhancements:
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1. Fixed a bug related to the length of the dlcode/ulcode in the
													<br/>
     protocol editor.  The maximum length of this string is 6 chars.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2. No process was in place to prevent ul/dl statistical variable
													<br/>
     overrun, fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3. The color from the auto-logoff countdown procedure carried the
													<br/>
     last color to the next line, fixed.  This would only be noticed
													<br/>
     if the user escaped or cancelled the auto-logoff.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  5. The color from the scaninput procedure carried the last color to
													<br/>
     the next line, fixed. I noticed this with the batch download file
													<br/>
     remove command.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  6. Since files added to the batch downloaded queue are listed as such
													<br/>
     in the sysop.log, it only made since to list files removed from
													<br/>
     the batch download queue in the sysop.log as well. An entry to
													<br/>
     the sysop.log is also made when the batch download queue is
													<br/>
     cleared.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8. The uploader name/date and the message to the user to continue a
													<br/>
     resume file did not redisplay the file name when wrapped to the
													<br/>
     next page while utlizing the file list command, fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  9. I think I finally have some issues corrected with the file
													<br/>
     listing display.  Every now and then an extra file area
													<br/>
     header would display when not needed.  Also, sometimes the line
													<br/>
     counter would be off by one or two lines and push the file area
													<br/>
     header up one or two lines or completely off the screen.  I also
													<br/>
     noticed a line feed missing when the listing was aborted or
													<br/>
     exited normally.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
Renegade bug fix's/enhancements:
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1.  Due to space limitations, the file listing display will utilize
													<br/>
      bytes or kbytes depending on the file point settings in the
													<br/>
      system configuration. To be consistant, this process is now
													<br/>
      also being utilized for the file size displayed when a file is
													<br/>
      selected for download.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2.  When a file is selected for viewing, the user will be cautioned
													<br/>
      that the file is not checked to ensure it is an ascii text file
													<br/>
      and then asked if they would like to continue.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3.  The file listing download and add batch prompt has been cleaned
													<br/>
      up.  It would formally allow input of '-' by itself or the '-'
													<br/>
      proceeding or following a file number and alpha characters. The
													<br/>
      input of an invalid file number will now display a message to the
													<br/>
      user.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  4.  Adding a file to the batch queue from the file listing display
													<br/>
      will now display all the file information related to that file.
													<br/>
      It will also now properly check the file to ensure it is ok to
													<br/>
      download and send it thru the proper ratio checks.  I have to
													<br/>
      admit that this was an oversite on my part when I added the
													<br/>
      ability to select a file by number.  Basically it now goes
													<br/>
      directly thru the DLX procedure vice being added directly to
													<br/>
      the batch download queue.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
File download bug fixes/enhancements:
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1.  I fixed an issue with certain commands accessed from the
													<br/>
      file listing menu.  For example, the file edit command would
													<br/>
      allow you to edit whatever file you selected, but when you
													<br/>
      returned to the file list, it wouldn't return you to the
													<br/>
      proper record.  This appears to have been a long standing
													<br/>
      issue and I may have additional commands to correct that might
													<br/>
      be added to this menu.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2.  I added a new command to the file listing menu.  This command
													<br/>
      allows you to flag a file to edit like the batch flag or flag
													<br/>
      download.  The command is "L8".  You can select by number or
													<br/>
      range and go back and forth thru the range like you could if
													<br/>
      you were using the regular file edit command.  You must have
													<br/>
      File Sysop access to utilize this command.
													<br/>
													<br/>
<h1 id="09-30.6"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v09-30.6/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>
													<br/>
 1.  FIXED  - The Auto Time Display Flag (A) in the Menu Editor
													<br/>
               would not toggle on or off, this has been corrected.
													<br/>
               The Menu List Number and Menu Number was right
													<br/>
               justified to make for a better looking display and
													<br/>
               "(C)ommand editor" was added to the Prompt.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2. CHANGE  - In preparation for converting the Email System over
													<br/>
               to have the same look and feel of the message system,
													<br/>
               the following commands were changed in the Out Going
													<br/>
               Mail command:
													<br/>
													<br/>
               (P)revious was changed to (-)Previous
													<br/>
               (R)e-read was changed to (A)gain
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3.  FIXED  - The File Editor would give the option to delete
													<br/>
               all data files associated to an area when that
													<br/>
               area was deleted.  The problem was that it would only
													<br/>
               delete the *.DIR file and not the *.EXT or *.SCN files.
													<br/>
               The File Editor would also give the option of copying
													<br/>
               the data files over to the new directory when the "I"
													<br/>
               option was toggled in the File Area Flags.  The problem
													<br/>
               was that it would only copy the *.DIR file and not the
													<br/>
               *.EXT or *.SCN files, these have both been fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  4. CHANGE  - All extended file descriptions were previously saved to
													<br/>
               one file (EXTENDED.DAT).  This has been changed so that
													<br/>
               all file areas have their own individual *.EXT file.
													<br/>
               Should the EXTENDED.DAT file ever get corrupted, you could
													<br/>
               have possibly lost all extended description for your entire
													<br/>
               file area.  This will also help make it easier to add
													<br/>
               code for actually deleting the extended description for
													<br/>
               any files that you delete from a file area. Previously
													<br/>
               extended file descriptions were not actually deleted, only
													<br/>
               blocked out from access taking up hard drive space. That's
													<br/>
               969 bytes for every file!
													<br/>
													<br/>
  5.  FIXED  - The file move command still allowed moving a file to file
													<br/>
               area 0, which doesn't exists, fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  6.  ADDED  - Internal FILES.BBS importer.  New Menu CMD Key "FC" allows
													<br/>
               the scanning of all file areas configured inside of
													<br/>
               Renegade to import descriptions from anything that lists
													<br/>
               a FILES.BBS such as shareware CDs.  Also, instead of
													<br/>
               loading Renegade, load Renegade via cmd line -F to start
													<br/>
               the FILES.BBS importer without loading Renegade itself.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  7. FIXED   - All Menu Editor related bugs to adding/removing menus.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8. ADDED   - Option to allow the use of multiple "quote headers".
													<br/>
               With this option, you will be able to change the
													<br/>
               quote header on each base.  This will default to what
													<br/>
               ever is in the RENEGADE.LNG file.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  9. ADDED   - Option to allow the use of multiple "read prompt" menus
													<br/>
               per message area.  This will allow the SysOp to make
													<br/>
               seperate menu cmds for each base if need be.  This is
													<br/>
               mainly used if you want seperate conferences for
													<br/>
               certain bases or certain access and cmds for certain
													<br/>
               message areas.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 10. ADDED   - Option to allow the posting of a text file PER message
													<br/>
               area each time a user posts.  Yes, we know this will
													<br/>
               get old, but it will allow say a posting of "rules" to
													<br/>
               be displayed to the user at each posting thus washing
													<br/>
               your hands of a matter when the user says he has no
													<br/>
               idea he wasn't allowed to do something in a certain
													<br/>
               message area.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 11. CHANGE  - Extended the length of the message posts.  (ie:
													<br/>
               email/public/private) to 500 lines max.  The current
													<br/>
               default was set to 200, but you were getting no more
													<br/>
               than 50-60 depending on the amount of memory that was
													<br/>
               installed into the computer.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 12. UPDATE  - Removed most system menus to external string files.
													<br/>
               Also added a compiler for these new string files.
													<br/>
               This will allow the use of the software in any
													<br/>
               language and allow faster access to the menus than
													<br/>
               they were before.  We will shortly be pulling all
													<br/>
               strings and messages from within the code and
													<br/>
               making them external.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 13. ADDED   - New CMD Keys QQ - Random Quote Generator Display.
													<br/>
               Compile your quote text file with RGQUOTE and
													<br/>
               make a menu cmd and place the QUOTE file name
													<br/>
               in the options field to display the quotes one at
													<br/>
               a time.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 14. ADDED   - Toggle under system config to turn the above
													<br/>
               feature ON or OFF at logon.  This works much like
													<br/>
               the AutoMessage feature works.  Must have LGNQUOTE
													<br/>
               compiled and in the DATA directory for this option
													<br/>
               to work.  LGNQUOTE is compiled with RGQUOTE.EXE.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 15. ADDED   - Option in Message Base to turn ON or OFF tagline
													<br/>
               addition to the message you have just posted.  For
													<br/>
               this option to work TAGLINE.TXT must reside in the
													<br/>
               DATA directory and be compiled with TAGLINE.EXE.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 16. ADDED   - Auto Random quoting at the end of messages.  E-Mail
													<br/>
               Local, and Echo Message areas will automatically
													<br/>
               have a quote added at the bottom of the message.
													<br/>
               This can be toggled ON/OFF on each message base
													<br/>
               and now EMAIL.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 17. ADDED   - The E-Mail Subsystem has been added to the Message
													<br/>
               base editor.  This will be record 0, which you can
													<br/>
               edit certain features and strings.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 18. ADDED   - Option to add to quote file at logon via system
													<br/>
               config toggle.  This will create a file called
													<br/>
               *.NEW (Taking on the firstname of whichever
													<br/>
               quotefile a quote was added to.) and then you
													<br/>
               can then copy new quotes over into the correct
													<br/>
               file and recompile it.  Please note, you MUST
													<br/>
               erase this file when you are done with it or it
													<br/>
               will continue to append to the end of the file
													<br/>
               and take up space.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 18. ADDED   - Option to add a quote to E-Mail or a Message is
													<br/>
               now asked after the message is saved.  This can
													<br/>
               be toggled ON/OFF in the message base editor.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 19. FIXED   - Standardize the SysOp.Log File - The log file
													<br/>
               was cutting off a user if they logged on around
													<br/>
               midnight of that night.  They were either tossed
													<br/>
               into the night before or the current one.  This
													<br/>
               has no been corrected to be sorted into the
													<br/>
               correct file.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
<h1 id="06-30.6"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v06-30.6/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1.  FIXED  - /S command in teleconference not displaying the
													<br/>
               correct information (or any actually).  This has
													<br/>
               now been corrected.  Basically fixed all commands
													<br/>
               in the teleconference to work properly.  Removed
													<br/>
               all 0-, 5-, 1- and such debugging code as well.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2.  FIXED  - Total Free Space Showing on the WFC Screen is now
													<br/>
               displaying correctly up to 999.9 megs.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3.  CHANGE - The Menu system is now non-existant as text files.
													<br/>
               They have been converted over to DATA files with
													<br/>
               a new MENU EDITOR added into Renegade.  This frees
													<br/>
               up from internal memory and speeds things up a bit.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  4.  ADDED  - Added option under S. System Config, A. Main BBS Config,
													<br/>
               K. System Menus.  This is where it will tell Renegade
													<br/>
               which are the main system menus and that are not allowed
													<br/>
               to be deleted.  This also plays into the effect of
													<br/>
               all the numbered menus now instead of names.  The
													<br/>
               included Menu Converter will take care of this and
													<br/>
               any/all menus you have.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  5.  FIXED  - Annonying "Cannot Load NODEx.DAT file" error.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  6.  UPDATE - File/Message/Protocol/Event Editors to more closely
													<br/>
               reflect the look and feel of the menu editor.  Thus,
													<br/>
               giving things a more universal look and feel.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  7.  FIXED  - The option to edit the arctype in the File Menu.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8.  FIXED  - The Shell to DOS in the WFC was a "J" (Not listed) and
													<br/>
               renamed it to "D" to conform with the WFC Screen.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  9.  FIXED  - The option for using a "U" to determine if you were
													<br/>
               doing anything with batch upload command or batch
													<br/>
               download commands compared against a capital "U", the
													<br/>
               problem was that the file editor allows lower case
													<br/>
               entry of this "U", added and allcaps to the menu were
													<br/>
               it compared the two.  Didn't change the file editor
													<br/>
               to still allow lower case for the options.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 10. REMOVE  - The option to PRINT SysOp Log files.  This command
													<br/>
               only printed to the LPT port.  Really, who has a
													<br/>
               LPT Printer anymore?  Command removed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 11. CHANGE  - Removed all extra spacing after internal prompts
													<br/>
               left.   ie: before "Menu Prompt :"  now "Menu Prompt:"
													<br/>
													<br/>
 12. CHANGE  - 200 Menu commands are now allowed per each menu
													<br/>
               set.  This was defaulted to 100.  200 Should be more
													<br/>
               than enough for any users.  If you need more, you
													<br/>
               need a life! ;)
													<br/>
													<br/>
 13.  FIXED  - Batch Files: Any files left in the Batch Queue after
													<br/>
               logoff would not be stored for download after the
													<br/>
               next logon to the BBS.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 14.  CHANGE - Overlays are revamped and the param switch -D for 
													<br/>
               disabling EMX/XMS and -O for setting the OvrExtraSize
													<br/>
               (Default 64K).  The -D switch was added incase for
													<br/>
               some odd reason an EMS/XMS driver is not detected
													<br/>
               and Renegade will not load.  By using -D you will
													<br/>
               be able to load Renegade's Overlay to DISK and
													<br/>
               still be able to access the BBS to correct the error.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 14.  CHANGE - TOGGLES.DAT file is removed and is added internal to
													<br/>
               Renegade.  This effects two options.  The option of
													<br/>
               the access for the laston.dat file needs to be rest
													<br/>
               if you changed it.  The toggles are all there and
													<br/>
               must be reset as a few were added.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 15.  ADDED  - User Editor Option '/' key.  This is where you can set
													<br/>
               all defaults for a newuser up to answering all the
													<br/>
               newuser questions, the autoval is still there for after
													<br/>
               these questions are answered.  Prior to this update,
													<br/>
               you couldn't change anything before a newuser was
													<br/>
               validated since they were hard coded in the program.
													<br/>
               Anything you do in Rec 0 (Zero) will carry over past
													<br/>
               autoval if the autoval didn't change the option.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 16.  FIXED  - Display issues with the protocols. The RENEGADE.LNG file
													<br/>
               allowed entry of PROTLIST which displayed a list of
													<br/>
               protocols in addition to the PROT*.ASC files or internal
													<br/>
               protocols. Either delete the PROTLIST entry from
													<br/>
               RENEGADE.LNG or delete PROT*.ASC from the MISC Directory.
													<br/>
               You may also now hide protocols if you do not wish a
													<br/>
               discription to be displayed to the user.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 17.  MISC   - The internal variable for NODE which should have been
													<br/>
               a byte variable was in fact either a word or integer
													<br/>
               variable.  Reduced file reads when listing protocols
													<br/>
               from 3 reads down to 2 reads.  This should make things
													<br/>
               abit faster.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 18.  FIXED  - When updating the node, a comparison of the Node
													<br/>
               number to the Activity was made to set invisible
													<br/>
               mode instead of being compared Node to Node. Removed
													<br/>
               this since Invisible mode is set at Logon and
													<br/>
               via a menu comand.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 19.  FIXED  - The length of the path/filename string for unlisted
													<br/>
               downloads was 78 and the length of the string in
													<br/>
               the batchdl was 65.  Changed both to a length of 52
													<br/>
               (40=Path/12-Filename) to conform with other
													<br/>
               path/filenames used throughout the file system.  A
													<br/>
               length of 78 would have been a waist of space since
													<br/>
               most dl's are listed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 20.  FIXED  - The download time is now properly updated when
													<br/>
               batchdl's were saved for the next logon.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 21.  CHANGE - The node activity would report that you were in a
													<br/>
               door when uploading files.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 22.  FIXED  - Certain protocols when selected were passed to the
													<br/>
               seek/read procedures that were negative causing a
													<br/>
               runtime error of 100.  This has now been corrected so
													<br/>
               that only numbers from zero and above are passed to
													<br/>
               these procedures.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 23.  FIXED  - Event Editor - If setting an event to SORT FILES,
													<br/>
               this event would never run as the command to SORT
													<br/>
               FILES (ie: S) was not a valid option.  This has been
													<br/>
               corrected.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 24.  UPDATE - The NEW bulletins displayed at logon would occasionaly
													<br/>
               display 0's (Zero) instead of just the bulletins that
													<br/>
               were actually updated since your last logon.  This has
													<br/>
               now been corrected.  Leading zero's were added to those
													<br/>
               bulletin numbers below 10 to make for a better looking
													<br/>
               display when listed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 25.  ADDED  - Added Menu Option TD to erase BBS's from the BBS
													<br/>
               Listing.  This will be listed in the updated
													<br/>
               MENUCMD.ASC file in the next release.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 25.  ADDED  - Added Menu Command Option (N.) to each menu command.
													<br/>
               This command will update the node activity for each
													<br/>
               command.  If someone is playing LORD, you can set N.
													<br/>
               to "Playing LORD" in the same command as your batch
													<br/>
               file is placed.  No more need to use the NW command
													<br/>
               before and after a cmd is run to update the
													<br/>
               multinode information to Renegade's Who's Online.
													<br/>
													<br/>
                          ********** NOTE ***********
													<br/>
													<br/>
               Activity Field is now able to be a MAXIMUM of 50
													<br/>
               charcters long.
													<br/>
													<br/>
26.    ADDED - New Toggle Option.  Users will now have the option
													<br/>
               of answering a question to be able to logon the BBS
													<br/>
               after forgetting their password.  This can be
													<br/>
               toggled ON/OFF via the toggles menu.  Once the user
													<br/>
               correctly answers the question, they then will be
													<br/>
               able to set a new password before logging onto the
													<br/>
               BBS.  A Mininote to the SysOp will be sent as well
													<br/>
               as a sysop log file line will be written.
													<br/>
													<br/>
27.    ADDED - Sysop Logging for the User Lister and Sysop Logging
													<br/>
               for Todays Callers.  Just to show what the user
													<br/>
               was doing while online. (Nice to know once in a
													<br/>
               while that a command is being used. 
													<G>)
														<br/>
														<br/>
28.    FIXED - The File Sort Routine was setup to access File
														<br/>
               Area 0 which Doesn't exist, so this was changed to
														<br/>
               File Area 01.
														<br/>
														<br/>
29.    FIXED - Logoff time was not properly being passed to the
														<br/>
               SYSOP.LOG file.  Now, the sysop.log file will show
														<br/>
               user logon time, logon node number, what they did
														<br/>
               while online, and logoff time of that node.
														<br/>
														<br/>
30.   CHANGE - Logoff entry in Sysop.Log now indicates Node Number.
														<br/>
														<br/>
31.    FIXED - The Forgot PW question will now redisplay and can
														<br/>
               be edited without retyping the whole damn thing! ;)
														<br/>
														<br/>
32.   CHANGE - The User List can now be viewed a number of different
														<br/>
               ways.  You can view the list via choosing several
														<br/>
               different options to sort it by.  Location, Sex,
														<br/>
               State, etc.  Or you still can view it as it was for
														<br/>
               the last 1000 years. ;)
														<br/>
														<br/>
33.   CHANGE - File Area Toggle Scan Flags (Command)
														<br/>
														<br/>
               Removed the "Q" for quit, pressing 
	<Enter> now quits
															<br/>
               this command and the command no longer scrolls on the
															<br/>
               screen like it did when the "Q" was required.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Reduced the actual toggling of the scan flags from 3
															<br/>
               separate processes down to just one procedure.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Pressing "-" alone will now exit vice scrolling the
															<br/>
               command.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Reduced the input string from 15 down to 9 chars
															<br/>
               since the max range that can be entered is xxxx-xxxx.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Added an input background.
															<br/>
															<br/>
34.   CHANGE - File Area New Scan Date (Command)
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Removed the extra Line Feed from RENEGADE.LNG File.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Added error checking for date entered past the
															<br/>
               current date.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Reduce the input string from 160 down to 10 chars
															<br/>
               since the max length of the date is xx/xx/xxxx.
															<br/>
															<br/>
35.    ADDED - File Tagging to the File areas.  File Names can now
															<br/>
               be downloaded or added to Batch via a simple number
															<br/>
               instead of typing out the full filename each time.
															<br/>
               Batch downloads can be downloaded via XX-YY cmd.
															<br/>
               ie:  4-7, would download files numbered 4, 5, 6, 7.
															<br/>
															<br/>
36.    ADDED - AR Flags - You now have the option to press ? when
															<br/>
               editing user AR Flags.  ARFLAGS.ANS/.ASC is to be put
															<br/>
               in the MISC directory and is used by the SysOp so
															<br/>
               they know which flag is for what and who.  Just a
															<br/>
               simple little reminder.  Hope this helps some.
															<br/>
															<br/>
37.   CHANGE - File Points are now ranged from 0-999 to more closely
															<br/>
               reflect an acutal file point system.  I just can't
															<br/>
               see someone having to pay 32000 points for a file. ;)
															<br/>
															<br/>
38.   CHANGE - At logon, you will be prompted to download files
															<br/>
               in which you have left in your batch queue after
															<br/>
               last logoff.
															<br/>
															<br/>
39.   CHANGE - File Prompt Header - The File Prompt header will
															<br/>
               redisplay at each screen.  No longer will you have
															<br/>
               to wonder which file area you are in.  This gives
															<br/>
               the file system a nice rounded out look as well.
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
<h1 id="05-19.4"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v05-19.4/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>

															<br/>
															<br/>
 1.  CHANGE -   Updated Copyright notice to reflect the new year.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 2.  FIXED  -   Slight Memory leak in v01-10.4/DOS.  This in turn would
															<br/>
                cause Renegade to eventuatly eat up all availble memory
															<br/>
                in a few years of use if the computer was never rebooted.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 3.  ADDED  -   /F MENUCMD to disable MCI Codes from displaying inside
															<br/>
                of a text file.  This MENUCMD compliments the -F CMD Key.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 4.  ADDED  -   Option /M when entering a message to turn on or off
															<br/>
                using MCI Codes per message.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 5.  ADDED  -   Added option to allow the SysOp access to the amount
															<br/>
                of time to give each timeslice.  This may help some systems
															<br/>
                in which Renegade hogs a lot of CPU (ie: Windows 2000). If
															<br/>
                you do not have much of a problem with sluggish performance
															<br/>
                it is suggested that you leave this option at the default
															<br/>
                setting. (10-40 optimal setting)
															<br/>
															<br/>
                [System Config -> D. System Variables -> V. Time Slices]
															<br/>
															<br/>
 6.  FIXED  -   Slight problem when displaying "NEW" bulletins to users
															<br/>
                when they first logon.  Renegade would display 22 of them
															<br/>
                across, then start putting each new one on a new line.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 7.  REMOVE -   Removed "Digiboard" support in the codebase.  Really,
															<br/>
                who would use one of those now-a-days anyways with a DOS
															<br/>
                based BBS?  If this is an issue for anyone, please e-mail
															<br/>
                us and we'll take care of it for you.
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
 8.  ADDED  -   Added option to System Config to post the BBS's telnet
															<br/>
                URL.  This is under System Conifg, Option A Main BBS Config.
															<br/>
                Just a cosmetic add, as before you could only type in a
															<br/>
                telephone number for the BBS.  Now you have a choice. ;)
															<br/>
															<br/>
 9.  ADDED  -   Added ~TN MCI Code to BBSME.ASC/ANS and BBSMN.ASC/ANS
															<br/>
                to reflect the new Telnet address line to the BBS list.
															<br/>
															<br/>
10.  CHANGE -   Changed the follow command keys to reflect new BBS
															<br/>
                list format change.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                       {  See Below for list of CMD Keys  }
															<br/>
															<br/>
                OB : Changed to CMD Key   TV   {short view of bbslist}
															<br/>
                OA : Changed to CMD Key   TA   {Add to bbslist}
															<br/>
															<br/>
                Added the following CMD Keys to be able to have more
															<br/>
                control over the BBS List.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                TA  : BBSList Add           {formally CMD Key OB}
															<br/>
                TE  : BBSList Edit 
															<br/>
                TV  : BBSList Short View    {formally CMD Key OV}
															<br/>
                TX  : BBSList Extended View {formally CMD Key OV}
															<br/>
															<br/>
                { Updated MENUCMD.ASC file to reflect these changes }
															<br/>
															<br/>
11.  CHANGE -   BBS Listing is now scriptable.  This means that you
															<br/>
                now can add just about any question for the BBS you wish.
															<br/>
                MCI Codes reflect the different questions (1-8) to display
															<br/>
                when a user views the BBS List.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                { Added BBSLIST.SCR file to reflect this update }
															<br/>
															<br/>
                *** BBSLIST.SCR MUST BE IN THE \BBS\MISC DIRECTORY ***
															<br/>
															<br/>
12.  ADDED  -   %xA / %xB / %xC / %xD / %xE / %xF for extra definable
															<br/>
                sysop strings in the BBSLIST.SCR file.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                                x:= to the following values.
															<br/>
                a = 8 chars / b = 30 / c = 30 / d = 40 / e = 60 / f = 60
															<br/>
															<br/>
                Also added %S2 for and extra line of descrition of the
															<br/>
                BBS.  Changed the way it stores the SOFTWARE. It's all
															<br/>
                in capital letters now.  Also, added that if can't find
															<br/>
                BBSMN.ASC it will echo back that in the sysop log and
															<br/>
                just print out the bbslist.sysopname, etc and proceed.
															<br/>
															<br/>
13.  ADDED  -   BBS*.ASC New MCI - ~WS (website) ~RN (Record Number)
															<br/>
															<br/>
14.  CHANGE -   -TG and -TS command line loaders for Renegade are
															<br/>
                now simply just -T for all telnet connections.  Unless
															<br/>
                you are using COM/IP as your emulator which the command
															<br/>
                line changed to -TC (ie: renegade.exe -n4 -tc).
															<br/>
															<br/>
16.  UPDATE -   The Official Renegade Home page is now located at URL:
															<br/>
                              http://www.renegadebbs.net
															<br/>
															<br/>
17.  REMOVE -   Removed the "Moving xx to xx" from writing to the
															<br/>
                SYSOPx.LOG file.  Saved some clutter there. ;)
															<br/>
															<br/>
18.  FIXED  -   The Telnet URL will now save correctly in the
															<br/>
                system config and not constantly erase itself.
															<br/>
                Will have to set for each node.
															<br/>
															<br/>
19.  CHANGE -   Bulletins now compare Time and Date of Files vs Time
															<br/>
                and Date of last logon to display as NEW.
															<br/>
															<br/>
20.  CHANGE -   NODE*.ASC instead of showning a '-' when a user isn't
															<br/>
                on a node it will echo back the node number for ~NN, then
															<br/>
                for ~AV it will display 'Y'. MCI Code ~AC is a 20 Chars
															<br/>
                String and ~UN is a 36 character string.
															<br/>
															<br/>
21.  CHANGE -   The Caller ID switch is now -ID instead of just -I
															<br/>
                Also -IP puts the IP (if present) into the Caller ID field
															<br/>
                in the User Editor and anything to do with Caller ID.
															<br/>
															<br/>
22.  ADDED  -   The String Editor is now removed from Renegade.  All
															<br/>
                strings within the editor are now EXTERNAL.  We will
															<br/>
                slowly be removing all strings from within Renegade's
															<br/>
                code and making them external for easy editing!  Also
															<br/>
                created DUMP to "dump" the STRING.DAT file to the
															<br/>
                editable language file. (data\renegade.lng)
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
<h1 id="01-10.4"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v01-10.4/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>
															<br/>
															<br/>
  1.  FIXED  - Bulletins - Now will correctly display if a bulletin
															<br/>
               is new or not to the user per call and are sorted
															<br/>
               in numerical order.  ie: (2, 7, 19, 22) instead of
															<br/>
               (22, 2, 19, 7).
															<br/>
															<br/>
  2.  ADDED  - (-T, /T) Toggle.  This will inturn toggle all baud
															<br/>
               rate speeds to show as "TELNET".  This also disables
															<br/>
               most comm routines relating to logoffs.  With -T
															<br/>
               added to loading Renegade, it will no longer pause
															<br/>
               for a set number of seconds before the BBS will
															<br/>
               hang the user up.  DO NOT use this command on
															<br/>
               dialup nodes!  Use this on TELNET ONLY NODES!!!!
															<br/>
															<br/>
   3. REVISED  (-T, /T) (-TG, /TG) (-TS, /TS) Load Toggle.
															<br/>
               This will inturn toggle the MCI Code ~SP in
															<br/>
               the last caller ANSI/ASCII to show 'BAUD'.
															<br/>
               (-T, /T) will do the hang-up procedure on a
															<br/>
               regular log-off for COM/IP.  (-TG, /TG) & (-TS, /TS)
															<br/>
               will bypass the passing of the ATH0 hangup string
															<br/>
               to the fossil/com port and will work with GameSrv
															<br/>
               or Synchronet respectivly.  This fix's issues of
															<br/>
               slow hangups while doing a telnet session.
															<br/>
               DO NOT use this command with dialup nodes!
															<br/>
															<br/>
   3. FIXED  - Fixed Toggles Menu and added warning screen about
															<br/>
               the use of certain toggles and what else should be
															<br/>
               changed or certain users may not be able to log
															<br/>
               back on to the BBS.  (ie:  If you have the BBS
															<br/>
               check for birthday's and have the toggle to ask
															<br/>
               for the birthday at new logon set to NO, the user
															<br/>
               will not be able to logon the BBS since he will not
															<br/>
               have a birthday set in the user record.)
															<br/>
															<br/>
   4. FIXED  - Added Time Slice Routines to certain functions in
															<br/>
               Renegade where it awaits for a user input.  This
															<br/>
               SHOULD fix some slow downs while running under
															<br/>
               some version of Windows.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   5. FIXED  - Fixed Memory problems with downloads and swapping
															<br/>
               Renegade out of memory which in turn caused some
															<br/>
               doors not to function.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   6. CHANGE - Changed all file sizes in Renegade to now show as
															<br/>
               Kilobyte (KB), and Megabytes (MB) instead of just
															<br/>
               bytes. (ie: 64,564 bytes NOW DISPLAYS AS 64.5 KB)
															<br/>
               Also changes to the WFC Screen to reflect this.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   7. FIXED  - Fixed upload Limit of 8.1 MB.  Now, will show
															<br/>
               files with sizes up to 1.9 GB.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   8. FIXED  - Fixed the AR, AC Flags [- OF -] toggle command to
															<br/>
               NOT be case sensitive.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   9. ADDED  - MCI Code telnet - This MCI Code shows the users speed,
															<br/>
               ie: Telnet, Local, or Actual Baud Rate.
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
<h1 id="11-26.3"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v11-26.3/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>

(Nov 26, 2003)
															<br/>
															<br/>
  01 -  Made NEWUSER Questions Configurable.  Only questions that are
															<br/>
        required are the User Handle, and User Password.  These toggles
															<br/>
        will be kept in a file called TOGGLES.DAT in the DATA directory.
															<br/>
        If this file is deleted, Renegade will remake the file with the
															<br/>
        defaults. (System Config, N - New User Toggles)
															<br/>
															<br/>
  02 -  Extended FILE_ID.DIZ Description length from 10 lines to 20
															<br/>
        lines.  Read UPDATE.DOC (VERY, VERY IMPORTANT!!!)
															<br/>
															<br/>
  03 -  Fixed:  When a user was downloading or uploading a file, Renegade
															<br/>
        still showed the user was able to be paged to chat.
															<br/>
															<br/>
  04 -  Fixed:  Bug in Renemail which wouldn't allow importing of netmail
															<br/>
        from a FrontEnd Mailer.

			<br/>
  What is Renegade?
			<br/>
  ---------
			<br/>
			<br/>
    Renegade BBS is a bulletin board software derived from the Telegard BBS
			<br/>
v2.5g source code. Telegard is in turn a modified version of the WWIV pascal
			<br/>
source code. Renegade, however has been vastly improved from the original
			<br/>
TG 2.5g source.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    Changes can be browsed from a file known as WHATDONE which list the
			<br/>
hundreds of changes made to the original code. Renegade offers SysOps the
			<br/>
ultimate in BBS configuration, allowing your BBS to achieve a UNIQUE look and
			<br/>
feel.

  Chapter 1-B: Installing Renegade
			<br/>
  ---------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Unzip the distribution archive into a temporary directory, and
			<br/>
run INSTALL.EXE. Answer the questions as you're prompted.
			<br/>
			<br/>
That's it. :)
			<br/>
			<br/>
  ---------------------------
			<br/>
  Chapter 1-C: System Startup and Commandline Parameters
			<br/>
  ---------------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Renegade is started by changing to the main Renegade directory, and
			<br/>
typing 'RENEGADE'. If you do not have a fossil driver installed, you will
			<br/>
receive a message to that effect. If you wish to load Renegade without a
			<br/>
fossil driver, you must do so in Local mode, using the -L parameter,
			<br/>
detailed below.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Renegade accepts the following Commandline Parameters:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -?        This command displays a quick help screen of all
			<br/>
                  the commands listed below.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Bnnnnn   This command tells the BBS that a user is already
			<br/>
                  connected at nnnnn baud. When loading Renegade
			<br/>
                  with this parameter, the WFC screen will be skipped
			<br/>
                  and the user will be dropped directly into the logon
			<br/>
                  sequence.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -F        This command starts the FILES.BBS Importer.  It will
			<br/>
                  check all file areas for a FILES.BBS file, import the
			<br/>
                  files, then exit.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                  File_ID.DIZ will only be checked if allowed by System 
			<br/>
                  Config setting for this option.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -EEnnn    If a critical error occurs during the operation of the
			<br/>
                  BBS, it aborts to DOS with an ERRORLEVEL value of nnn.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -ENnnn    Whenever a user logs off, and the -Q parameter is
			<br/>
                  specified on the commandline, Renegade returns an
			<br/>
                  errorlevel of 0 if no new echomail was entered, and
			<br/>
                  an errorlevel of 2 if new echomail was entered. This
			<br/>
                  commandline changes the errorlevel Renegade will
			<br/>
                  exit with to nnn.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                  NOTE: When pressing Q from the WFC screen, Renegade will
			<br/>
                        exit with an errorlevel of 255, regardless of whether
			<br/>
                        or not this parameter is used.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Ixxx     If you wish to pass Called ID information to Renegade,
			<br/>
                  use this parameter. This is most likely to be used in
			<br/>
                  conjunction with a Front-End Mailer that supports Caller
			<br/>
                  ID.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -L        This tells Renegade to load itself in local mode. While
			<br/>
                  in local mode, Renegade will ignore the modem entirely (it
			<br/>
                  won't send anything out to the modem, and won't respond to
			<br/>
                  incoming calls)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Mn       Will create a QWK mail packet for user n then return
			<br/>
                  to DOS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Nn       Specifies which node to load (ie, -N1 loads Node 1, -N2
			<br/>
                  loads Node2, etc.). *Make Certain* that you've turned
			<br/>
                  multinode support on in the Main System Configuration before
			<br/>
                  you implement this parameter on your commandline.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -P        Pack the message bases and return to DOS. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -S        Sort the File areas and return to DOS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -T        Tells Renegade to run in "TELNET" Mode.  Use this option
			<br/>
                  when running Renegade with such servers as NET2BBS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -TC       Tells Renegade to run in "COM PORT TELNET" mode.  Use
			<br/>
                  this option when running with COM/IP or NetSerial.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Q        Quit to DOS instead of the WFC screen upon logoff.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Un       Will upload a REP mail packet for user n then return to
			<br/>
                  DOS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Xnnnn    External event start time in nnnn minutes.  Renegade will
			<br/>
                  treat this as a built in hard event and log the user off
			<br/>
                  in nnnn minutes.

			<br/>
			<br/>
          A         Sends the "modem answer" command to the modem.  It is
			<br/>
                    normally not used, but for testing the connections and
			<br/>
                    when you have an error, this is helpful. If everything is
			<br/>
                    configured correctly, the BBS should automatically answer
			<br/>
                    the phone.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          B         Enters the Message Base Editor (See Chapter 9)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          C         Displays todays list of callers.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          D         Drops to the OS command shell, allowing you to
			<br/>
                    use some commands that aren't available through
			<br/>
                    Mini-DOS. Type EXIT to retrun to the WFC Screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          E         Enters the Event Editor (See Chapter 12)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          F         Enters the File Base Editor (See Chapter 8)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          H         Sends the Hangup string to the modem.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          I         Sends the Initialization string to the modem.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          L         Displays the Sysop Logs. You can display either todays
			<br/>
                    log, or the backlog for up to how ever many days you
			<br/>
                    define as the maximum in the System Configuration.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          M         Allows reading of All Email messages posted to the
			<br/>
                    system. It does not specify the viewing of a particular
			<br/>
                    users email.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          N         Displays the list of users currently online. (MultiNode
			<br/>
                    Only)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          O         Sends the Offhook string to the modem
			<br/>
			<br/>
          P         Allows the Sysop to pack the message bases.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Q         Exits the BBS and returns to the OS with an ERRORLEVEL of
			<br/>
                    255.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          R         Prompts for a username, and then displays the contents
			<br/>
                    of that users mailbox.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          S         Enters the System Configuration. (See Chapter 6)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          U         Enters the User Editor. (See Chapter 7)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          V         Enters the Voting Editor (See Chapter 13)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          W         Allows you to send Email messages to other users,
			<br/>
                    either individually or via various mass mail criteria.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          X         Enters the Protocol Editor (See Chapter 10)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Z         Displays the usage log information contained in the
			<br/>
                    HISTORY.DAT file, which contains a record of all general
			<br/>
                    system activity.  Just to note, the percent activity is
			<br/>
                    roughly the number of minutes used that day divided by
			<br/>
                    1440 minutes (24 hours).
			<br/>
			<br/>
          #         Enters the Menu Editor (See Chapter 11)

			<br/>
                    manually or automatically.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          [SPACE]   Brings up the WFC local logon prompt. Choosing Y
			<br/>
                    will proceed with a normal logon, pressing F will
			<br/>
                    do a fast logon (skips most of the welcome screens)
			<br/>
                    and pressing N returns you to the WFC. If Local Security
			<br/>
                    Protection is turned On, the Fast Logon option will
			<br/>
                    not be available.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          $         Loads the Conference Editor (See Chapter 14)                    
			<br/>
			<br/>
          [TAB]     Switches you between modem and WFC mode.  In modem mode,
			<br/>
                    you can send commands to the modem, but if the phone
			<br/>
                    rings, Renegade will still answer the call.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          If Local Security Protection is turned On (See Chapter 6-E),
			<br/>
          then only two commands are available from the WFC Screen; [SPACE]
			<br/>
          and Q. Pressing Q will exit to DOS, just like the normal WFC
			<br/>
          command. [SPACE] will bring up a prompt for the sysop password.
			<br/>
          If the password is entered correctly, then the WFC can be used
			<br/>
          normally. If someone logs on, when they logoff the WFC screen
			<br/>
          will blank and then ask for the Password again. If the password
			<br/>
          is entered, and the WFC screen remains idle, after a time it'll
			<br/>
          prompt for the password again before functioning normally.

          Alt-B          Toggles "beep-after-end" on and off.  This feature
			<br/>
                         will take the phone offhook and sound an alarm when
			<br/>
                         the user logs off, letting you know that the system
			<br/>
                         is available for use.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-C          Toggles chat mode on and off.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-E          Allows modification of the user's security
			<br/>
                         information (SL, DSL, AR & AC flags, file points).
			<br/>
                         Prints the "SysOp working" string to the user while
			<br/>
                         this window is displayed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-F          Prints fake line noise to the user.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-G          Allows enabling and disabling of activity trapping
			<br/>
                         and chat capturing for a user.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-H          Hang up on a user and return to the WFC menu.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-I          Toggles the User's input On and Off. For the
			<br/>
                         obvious reasons, user input is toggled On. If
			<br/>
                         toggled Off, then the users keystrokes won't do
			<br/>
                         anything.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-K          Allows you to select a Hangup message to display
			<br/>
                         (HANGUPnn.*) before hanging up on the user and
			<br/>
                         returning to the WFC menu.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         This option has caused an undue amount of confusion
			<br/>
                         in it's time. When you press Alt-K, the following
			<br/>
                         prompt appears in the Sysop Window.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         Display what hangup file (HANGUPxx) :
			<br/>
                          >
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         The prompt is misleading; it can be interpreted
			<br/>
                         as telling a sysop to input the entire filename
			<br/>
                         of the hangup file they want to display.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         Uh uh. Let's say you've got hangup files HANGUP1.ASC
			<br/>
                         and HANGUP11.ANS. In order for the file to display,
			<br/>
                         you must type the number of the HANGUP file and
			<br/>
                         nothing more. Ie; When you want to display
			<br/>
                         HANGUP1.ASC, you would type 1 when prompted. If you
			<br/>
                         wanted to display HANGUP11.ANS, you'd type 11.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         The prompt is also misleading in that it shows it'll
			<br/>
                         accept two characters. It is okay to use 1 character,
			<br/>
                         as in HANGUP1.ASC above. Renegade won't complain.
			<br/>
                         However, if you named the file HANGUP01.ASC and then
			<br/>
                         pressed 1 at the prompt, HANGUP01.ASC would not
			<br/>
                         display; Renegade would be looking for 01, not 1.
			<br/>
                         Basically, whatever you input is what Renegade is
			<br/>
                         going to be looking for after the HANGUP portion of
			<br/>
                         the filename.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-L          Toggles the local screen on and off.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-M          Toggles temporary SysOp access for a user. If the
			<br/>
                         user still has Temp SysOp access when they logoff,
			<br/>
                         they will be returned to their original status
			<br/>
                         when next they call.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-N          Switches you to the next SysOp window in order.
			<br/>
                         Sysop Window must be turned on; see Alt-S
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-O          Conference System toggle. If toggled to off, any
			<br/>
                         access levels requiring the user to be in a certain
			<br/>
                         conference are ignored. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-P          Displays a file from the local harddisk to the
			<br/>
                         remote user.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-Q          Turns off the "user attempted to chat" alarm.
			<br/>
                         If a user pages the sysop when he's available and
			<br/>
                         the sysop doesn't answer, this annoying little
			<br/>
                         pager sound will continue. The only way to stop
			<br/>
                         it is to break into chat with the user, wait until
			<br/>
                         they logoff, or use Alt-Q. :)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-R          Displays the chat reason in the SysOp window.
			<br/>
                         Sysop Window must be turned on; see Alt-S
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-S          Enters SysOp/User Split Screen Chat Mode.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-T          Toggles the SysOp window display between the top
			<br/>
                         and bottom of the local screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-U          Toggles the user's input and output on and off.
			<br/>
                         Users input and output is toggled on at the
			<br/>
                         beginning of each call by default. If toggled
			<br/>
                         off, then the users keystrokes will not do anything.
			<br/>
                         In addition, the remote display will no longer
			<br/>
                         be updated; the remote user's screen is in essence
			<br/>
                         frozen until the sysop presses Alt-U again, or the
			<br/>
                         caller hangs up.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-V          Prompts the sysop for a validation level (as
			<br/>
                         defined in Subscription/Validation levels; See
			<br/>
                         Chapter 6-G) and then validates the online user
			<br/>
                         at the chosen level.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-W          Same as Alt-E except that the "SysOp working"
			<br/>
                         string is not displayed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-Z          Sends a continuous stream of beeps until the user
			<br/>
                         presses a key or hangs up.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-+          Adds five minutes to a user's total time left.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-          Subtracts five minutes from a user's total time
			<br/>
                         left.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-(F1-F5)    Changes to SysOp Window 1-5 depending on which
			<br/>
                         Function key you hit (F1-F5). Sysop Window must
			<br/>
                         be turned on; see Alt-S
			<br/>
			<br/>
          F1-F10         Hitting one of these keys will activate the SysOp

                         Defined Macro that was defined in System Variables.

                         (See Chapter 6-D)

          Ctrl-Home      Shows a help screen with all of the SysOp function

                         keys and a brief description.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     The following function keys are available anywhere in the system,

     whether or not a user is online:
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-n          Executes a batch file called "GLOBATn.BAT", where
			<br/>
                         "n" is a number from 1 to 9. (ie, if you have a batch
			<br/>
                         file named GLOBAT1.BAT, and press Alt-1, Renegade
			<br/>
                         will immediately run that batch file, Alt-2 runs
			<br/>
                         GLOBAT2.BAT, and so on)
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         The GLOBATn.BAT files must be present in your main
			<br/>
                         BBS directory.                        
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-D          Prompts for a filename and then captures the contents
			<br/>
                         of the screen to that filename. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-J          Performs a local shell to DOS. Sends the "SysOp
			<br/>
                         has shelled to DOS" string before entering DOS,
			<br/>
                         and the "thank you for waiting" string after
			<br/>
                         returning.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Scroll Lock    Toggles Sysop Availability for chat. If On, Sysop
			<br/>
                         is *not* available for chat at all. If Off, then
			<br/>
                         the regularly defined chat hours are used (if none
			<br/>
                         are defined, then the sysop pager will always be
			<br/>
                         active, unless Scroll Lock is turned On)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Ctrl-SysRq     Allows the SysOp to choose to generate a run
			<br/>
                         time error. (Cute, huh? :))

          "Y360" - Must be later than 6:00 am.
			<br/>
          "N1ER"   - Must be logged onto node 1 with RIP active.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     For added ACS control, there are five logical operators that can be
			<br/>
     used.
			<br/>
			<br/>
      For access to happen:
			<br/>
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			<br/>
          "&" - Logical AND   - both must be true
			<br/>
          "|" - Logical OR    - either can be true
			<br/>
          "!" - Logical NOT   - first is true second isn't
			<br/>
			<br/>
      These are the all on/off settings:
			<br/>
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			<br/>
          "^" - Logical TRUE  - everything is true
			<br/>
          "%" - Logical FALSE - everything is false
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Examples:
			<br/>
     ~~~~~~~~
			<br/>
      AND - "S20D50" requires the user has an SL of 20 *AND* a DSL of 50.
			<br/>
      OR  - "S20|FA" requires that the user have either SL 20 *OR* AR flag "A".
			<br/>
      NOT - "!FA" requires that the user *NOT* have AR flag "A".
			<br/>
			<br/>
     The TRUE and FALSE operators are used to give everyone access, or to
			<br/>
     give nobody access.  "^" means ALL users have access, and "%"
			<br/>
     means NO users at all have access.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     For even more complex ACS's, parentheses are allowed to group ACS settings
			<br/>
     together to be compared to another set:
			<br/>
     "S20FA|D255" means that the user must have at least SL 20 *AND* AR flag
			<br/>
     "A" *OR* DSL 255.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A few more examples:
			<br/>
			<br/>
          S50            User must have SL 50 or higher (50-255).
			<br/>
          !S50           User must *NOT* have SL 50 (0-49).
			<br/>
          VV|U1          User must be validated *OR* be user #1.
			<br/>
          A21FAS50       User must be 21 years old *AND* have AR flag "A"
			<br/>
                         *AND* have SL 50.
			<br/>
          !(A21FAS50)    User must *NOT* be 21 years old, have AR flag "A",
			<br/>
                         or have SL 50.
			<br/>
          !N234          User must *NOT* be logged onto node 234.

 Chapter 4 - Special Files
			<br/><br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
  Unless otherwise noted, all files mentioned in this section must be present
			<br/>
  in your MISC directory off the Renegade main path.
			<br/>
			<br/>
  -------------
			<br/>
  Chapter 4-A: The BBS List
			<br/>
  -------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
      Renegade's BBS List is now in binary format. It stores more information,
			<br/>
      and allows the person entering the BBS into the list to edit the
			<br/>
      information later. It displays in two formats, regular (the short,
			<br/>
      traditional format) and an extended version that includes much more
			<br/>
      thorough information. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
      The BBS List will now sort itself automatically, so no third party
			<br/>
      utils will be required. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
            Regular List:
			<br/>
			<br/>
              You can configure the format of the regular list with
			<br/>
              the following three files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
              BBSNH.xxx <- The Header 
			<br/>
              BBSNT.xxx <- The Trailer
			<br/>
              BBSMN.xxx <- The information displayed in between
			<br/>
			<br/>
            Extended Format:
			<br/>
			<br/>
              You can configure the format of the extended list with
			<br/>
              the following three files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
               BBSEH.xxx <- The Header
			<br/>
               BBSET.xxx <- The Trailer
			<br/>
               BBSME.xxx <- The information displayed in between
			<br/>
			<br/>
      In BBSMx.xxx, you can use the following local MCI codes:
			<br/>
			<br/>
    ~BN   BBS Name      ~DA   Date Added        ~DE   Date Edited
			<br/>
    ~DS   Description   ~PN   Phone Number      ~SN   SysOp Name
			<br/>
    ~SP   Speed         ~SW   Software          ~UN   User Added
			<br/>
			<br/>
      You are limited to 1024 bytes in BBSMx.xxx and all other configurable
			<br/>
      listings. Since this is for each entry, and *before* MCI interpretation,
			<br/>
      if you use that much, people are going to fall asleep waiting for the
			<br/>
      listing to end.

  Chapter 4-E: The Trashcan File
			<br/>
  ---------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
This file has gone undocumented for a very long time. :) What it is, simply,
			<br/>
is a plaintext file called TRASHCAN.TXT in your MISC directory containing the
			<br/>
names of people, or words, that you do not want to be able to apply to your
			<br/>
system. The format is one name per line, one after the other.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 Example:
			<br/>
			<br/>
    --BEGIN FILE--
			<br/>
    Ken Reaverson
			<br/>
    Adrian Blood
			<br/>
    Pretty Hate Machine
			<br/>
    --END FILE--
			<br/>
			<br/>
If I were to apply to your board, and this is what your TRASHCAN.TXT looked
			<br/>
like, I would receive the message 'Sorry, can't use that name' and prompted
			<br/>
to enter my name/handle again. It is not case sensitive, but it is spelling
			<br/>
sensitive. Also, there are no wildcards allowed (Adrian* will not prevent
			<br/>
Adrian Paul, Adrian Blood, or Adrian Blackburn from applying to your system
			<br/>
;))
			<br/>
			<br/>
  ----------------
			<br/>
  Chapter 4-F: The NEWLET.ASC File
			<br/>
  ----------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        This file, if it exists, will be sent to a new user when his account
			<br/>
        is saved to the user record. The file should be left in the MISC
			<br/>
        directory. It has the following format:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -----------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        [FROM]
			<br/>
        [SUBJECT]
			<br/>
        { MESSAGE TEXT (FIRST LINE)
			<br/>
                .
			<br/>
                .
			<br/>
                .
			<br/>
          (LAST LINE) }
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -----------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Each is on a separate line, and FROM is on the first line.  Any
			<br/>
        replies to this message are sent to the same user number as the
			<br/>
        new user application.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<br/>
  Chapter 4-G: The Global Menu
			<br/>
  --------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The Global Menu is an optional menu that can do some pretty cool
			<br/>
        stuff. Any command inserted into the global menu can be run from
			<br/>
        anywhere on the BBS. All regular Menu CmdKeys will work, with one
			<br/>
        exception. The GOSUB (-/) command will not work from the Global Menu.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        If the Global Menu is not already present, you'll have to create
			<br/>
        it yourself. Be very careful how you assign commands on the Global
			<br/>
        Menu. Make sure that the letters you assign aren't used anywhere
			<br/>
        else on the BBS, or they'll be run in sequence, and the results
			<br/>
        will probably be something different than what you had hoped for.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Example:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Let's say I want to insert a command that will check and see
			<br/>
        what users are online. I create a menu named GLOBAL.MNU in my
			<br/>
        MENU directory. I load up the Menu Editor and insert a new command
			<br/>
        that looks something like this:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Menu filename: GLOBAL
			<br/>
        Command #1 of 2
			<br/>
			<br/>
        1. Long descript :(/W)ho's Online
			<br/>
        2. Short descript:(/W)ho's Online
			<br/>
        3. Menu keys     :/W
			<br/>
        4. ACS required  :""
			<br/>
        5. Cmdkeys       :NO
			<br/>
                         ;(This is the CmdKey for the Who's On List)
			<br/>
        6. Options       :
			<br/>
        N. Node Activity :Who's Online?
			<br/>
                         ;(This is diplayed in Node Activity)
			<br/>
        T. Flags         :-
			<br/>
        Q. Quit
			<br/>
			<br/>
        From now on, no matter where I am, if I press /W, the Who's On List
			<br/>
        will display. Now, imagine if I had assigned the Menu Key as L
			<br/>
        instead of /W. If that had been the case, anywhere there was an L
			<br/>
        command already present, it would have run the present command first,
			<br/>
        and then the global one. So at the Main Menu, the Callers Today list
			<br/>
        would have displayed, followed immediately by the Whos On list.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        If you had to create the GLOBAL.MNU yourself, delete the Quit to
			<br/>
        Main Menu command already present in the menu; it's redundant.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        If there's a menu you *don't* want using the global commands, you can
			<br/>
        turn them off. Most of the default menus allow the use of the Global
			<br/>
        commands, and all new menus you create default to being able to use
			<br/>
        the menu commands. See Chapter 11-B for information on changing
			<br/>
        whether or not a menu uses the global commands.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<br/>
  Chapter 4-H: The READP, FILEP, and NEWINFO Menus
			<br/>
  ------------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        All three of the menus in this section must exist in the MENUS.DAT
			<br/>
        file in the DATA directory off the main Renegade Path.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        READP
			<br/>
			<br/>
        This is the menu that's used while reading any message on the BBS.
			<br/>
        Do *not* delete this file under any circumstance, and do not
			<br/>
        rename it. Renegade looks for the filename READP MENU, bad things
			<br/>
        happen when it doesn't exist. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        You can change the menu prompt, add in extra commands, and modify
			<br/>
        it just like any other menu, just be careful to keep the message
			<br/>
        reading and replying commands there. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        FILEP
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The FILEP MENU serves the same function as the READP MENU, except
			<br/>
        it's used when listing files. The cautions with the READP MENU
			<br/>
        apply here as well, do *not* delete or rename this file.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        NEWINFO
			<br/>
			<br/>
        As above, do not delete or rename this file, Renegade expects it,
			<br/>
        and new users won't be able to complete the application process if
			<br/>
        it doesn't exist.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        This is the final step before the user is actually saved to the
			<br/>
        user record. At this menu, they can change the information they've
			<br/>
        been asked during the application process. It is important to note;
			<br/>
        while at this menu, the user does not have a user number. Do not
			<br/>
        use any commands which will check for a user number, because it'll
			<br/>
        bomb out.
			<br/>

<h1 id="Chapter 5"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">-----------------------------------</h1>
 Chapter 5 - Changing Colors
			<br/><br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
     There are 2 easy ways of changing colors in Renegade.  The first
			<br/>
     method is usable almost everywhere in Renegade.  When you're where you
			<br/>
     want to change to another color, press [Ctrl-P] and then enter a number
			<br/>
     from 0-9.  Control-P is actually a macro type of key, because when you
			<br/>
     do hit Control P, a ^ appears.  The ^ is the actual, better way to change
			<br/>
     the colors.  From then on, the color will be the one you set with the last
			<br/>
     command.  It will stay the same color until the color is changed again by
			<br/>
     either the system or by another color code sequence.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
            NOTE: Just because the [Ctrl-P] key sequence does not produce
			<br/>
            ~~~~  the "^", doesn't mean you cannot change the color.  Simply
			<br/>
                  enter the "^" yourself.
			<br/>
			<br/>
            NOTE: As of 4-05 Exp, pressing Ctrl-P then the # will produce
			<br/>
                  the string. ie, [ctrl-p] 1 will produce "^1". In
			<br/>
                  previous versions, the color change was instant and
			<br/>
                  the user never saw the ^# part of the string.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Another way which can be used is called the Pipe System.  Where you
			<br/>
     want to change the color, enter a "|nn" (w/out quotes).  The nn is a
			<br/>
     number between 00 and 23. (2 digits MUST be used.).  The first 16 colors
			<br/>
     (00-15) affect the foreground color, and the last 8 (16-23) affect the
			<br/>
     background color.  The colors are as follows: (B. = Bright, D. = Dark)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        00: Black       08: D. Grey     16: Black
			<br/>
        01: Blue        09: B. Blue     17: Blue
			<br/>
        02: Green       10: B. Green    18: Green
			<br/>
        03: Cyan        11: B. Cyan     19: Cyan
			<br/>
        04: Red         12: B. Red      20: Red
			<br/>
        05: Purple      13: B. Purple   21: Purple
			<br/>
        06: Brown       14: Yellow      22: Brown
			<br/>
        07: Grey        15: B. White    23: White
			<br/>
			<br/>
      NOTE: On some cases, if you have used the ^# method of changing colors
			<br/>
      ~~~~  and the color you changed to with the ^ was flashing, you might
			<br/>
            have to enter another NON-FLASHING ^ code before you enter
			<br/>
            a pipe code.

   system configuration.  This section is normally selected by the "S" command
			<br/>
   at the WFC screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Once there, the following menu is displayed:

 -------------------------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
          A    This option allows you to enter the name and the phone
			<br/>
               number of your BBS. The Name defined here is what will be
			<br/>
               displayed by the %BN MCI Code, and the Phone number is what
			<br/>
               will be displayed by the %BP MCI Code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          B    This allows you to enter a telnet address for the BBS. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
          C    This option allows you to enter the username of the SysOp.
			<br/>
               This is mostly cosmetic; the only thing this option determines
			<br/>
               is what the %SN MCI Code will display.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          D    Displays Renegade's version.  This cannot be changed and is
			<br/>
               here only for show.  This is what is shown with the %VR MCI
			<br/>
               Code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          E    This option allows you to declare your chat hours.  When
			<br/>
               someone pages you during these hours, a bell will sound to
			<br/>
               inform you that a user wishes to chat.
			<br/>
			<br/>
               NOTE: If you do not declare chat hours, your users will
			<br/>
                     be able to page you at all hours.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          F    This option defines the hours that the minimum baud rate
			<br/>
               callers may log on.  Some SysOps prefer to restrict the hours
			<br/>
               available to users of lower baud modems for various reasons.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          G    This option defines the hours that file downloading is
			<br/>
               allowed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          H    This option defines the hours that low baud callers may
			<br/>
               download files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          I    This option brings up something like the following display:
			<br/>
			<br/>
                        System Passwords:
			<br/>
                          A. SysOp password        :
			<br/>
                          B. New user password     :
			<br/>
                          C. Baud override password:
			<br/>
			<br/>
                             A. Defines the SysOp Password. This is the only
			<br/>
                                one of the three passwords that must be
			<br/>
                                defined. In general, this is the password
			<br/>
                                that will be prompted for when using all
			<br/>
                                Sysop specific commands.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                             B. If this is defined, then any newuser applying
			<br/>
                                to the system will need to input this password
			<br/>
                                when prompted before continuing with the
			<br/>
                                application process. If this password is
			<br/>
                                not defined, then nothing will be asked for,
			<br/>
                                and a user may apply to the system unhindered.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                             C. If this password is defined and a user
			<br/>
                                connects at a baud rate lower than the
			<br/>
                                minimum logon baud rate defined in the
			<br/>
                                System Variables (See Chapter 6-D), then
			<br/>
                                the user will be prompted for this password.
			<br/>
                                If they get it right, they'll be allowed
			<br/>
                                to logon. If they get it wrong, Renegade
			<br/>
                                will hang up on them. If the password
			<br/>
                                is not defined and a user connects at a
			<br/>
                                lower baud rate than allowed, they'll simply
			<br/>
                                be hung up on.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          J    This options sets the number of seconds before a scheduled
			<br/>
               event is run in which the user is warned. In other words,
			<br/>
               if you've got an event running in two minutes, and this option
			<br/>
               is set to 60 seconds, Renegade would warn the user one minute
			<br/>
               before the event logged them off. If you an event was about
			<br/>
               to run in 5 minutes, and this option was set to 300 seconds,
			<br/>
               then the user would be warned five minutes in advance.

				<br/>
				<br/>
              These are the default menu numbers for the required menu
				<br/>
              board sets for the BBS to function.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
          L    Prefix of the Bulletin Files. (Normally left Blank or set to
				<br/>
               BULLET)  Refer to Chapter 11-D-12, Sub-Bulletins under the
				<br/>
               OS CmdKey for an explanation.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          M    This option allows you to tell Renegade if it has 1 or more
				<br/>
               nodes.  (If multi-node, you must use the -Nx command to load
				<br/>
               node x.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          N    This option will allow you to turn the Network mode on.  It
				<br/>
               activates the following:
				<br/>
				<br/>
                a) Forces local security on.
				<br/>
                b) Disables all function keys unless a SysOp is logged on.
				<br/>
                c) Disables the SysOp window system.
				<br/>
                d) All WFC commands are disabled except [SPACE] and Q.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
          0    This option defines the directory in which your main data
				<br/>
               files are stored. (.DAT, .DIR, etc.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          1    This option defines the directory in which your text files
				<br/>
               are stored.  (.ANS, .ASC, .INF, .ASW, etc.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          2    This option defines the directory in which your messages
				<br/>
               are stored. (.BRD, .MIX, etc.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          3    This option defines the directory in which the menu files
				<br/>
               are stored. (.MNU)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          4    This option defines the directory in which the Version 7
				<br/>
               Nodelist files will be stored. A Version 7 Nodelist is
				<br/>
               something compiled by a third party program. It is *not*
				<br/>
               the text file containing names, locations and phone numbers,
				<br/>
               and so on; that's the raw nodelist. The author of this
				<br/>
               documentation recommends QNode, written by James West, which
				<br/>
               should be available on any decent support BBS.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               What a Version 7 Nodelist does is aid in sending Netmail.
				<br/>
               If a Version 7 Nodelist exists, Renegade is able to fill
				<br/>
               in most of the blanks for you. When sending netmail without
				<br/>
               a Version 7 Nodelist defined, Renegade will ask for the
				<br/>
               following: Name of recipient, their address, and then the
				<br/>
               subject. It is quite possible for a message to be addressed
				<br/>
               incorrectly in this manner. If a Version 7 nodelist is
				<br/>
               defined, Renegade is a little more helpful; When sending
				<br/>
               Netmail, Renegade will ask for either a name or address:
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Enter a name, a Fidonet address, or an Internet address.
				<br/>
               :
				<br/>
				<br/>
               The Name it's looking for in this case is the name of the
				<br/>
               sysop, which is not necessarily the person you want to
				<br/>
               address the netmail to. If you don't know the name of the
				<br/>
               sysop, but you do know the address, use it. If you enter
				<br/>
               an invalid address, Renegade will form you of as much and
				<br/>
               ask you to try again. If you enter a valid address, a screen
				<br/>
               something like the following pops up:
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Enter a name, a Fidonet address, or an Internet address.
				<br/>
               :1:1/105
				<br/>
				<br/>
               System: The Titantic BBS (1:1/105)
				<br/>
               SysOp : T.J. McMillen 
				<br/>
               Phone : -UnPublished- 
				<br/>
               Where : Pennsylvania
				<br/>
               Cost  : 0 credits
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Is this correct? No
				<br/>
				<br/>
               If you confirm this is the correct information, Renegade will
				<br/>
               next ask who you want this addressed this netmail (it'll fill
				<br/>
               in the sysops name by default).
				<br/>
				<br/>
               By using a Version 7 nodelist, the mail isn't going to be
				<br/>
               addressed to a non-existent node. It also makes a user confirm
				<br/>
               their choice, thereby lessening the chances of accidentally
				<br/>
               addressing the netmail somewhere else.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          5    This option defines the directory in which the trap files,
				<br/>
               system log files and capture chat files are stored. (.LOG)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          6    This option defines the directory in which temporary files
				<br/>
               are stored.  This directory is used for various things to
				<br/>
               hold files while using them, but when they aren't permanent.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          7    This option defines the directory in which the protocol drivers
				<br/>
               will be held.  These include DSZ.EXE, HSLINK.EXE, etc. These
				<br/>
               files are used in the Protocol Editor as your file transfer
				<br/>
               programs.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          8    This option defines the directory in which the archive drivers
				<br/>
               will be held.  These include PKUNZIP.EXE, ARJ.EXE, PKZIP.EXE,
				<br/>
               RAR.EXE, etc.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          9    This is the directory in which your external string text files
				<br/>
               are stored.  Both compiled and raw.

  Chapter 6-B: Modem Configuration
				<br/>
  ----------------
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Modem Configuration allows you to set up how the modem and Renegade will
				<br/>
     work together.
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Upon selecting this option, the following menu is displayed:
				<br/>
 -----------------------------------
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Modem/Node Configuration
				<br/>
				<br/>
     1. Maximum baud rate: 57600               2. Port number      : 2

     7. COM port locking : On                  8. XON/XOFF flow    : Off
				<br/>
     9. CTS/RTS flow     : On                  A. ACS for this node:

     G. TeleConf Global  : [%UN GLOBAL]:
				<br/>
     H. TeleConf Private : [%UN PRIVATE]:
				<br/>
     I. IRQ string       : 4
				<br/>
     J. Address string   : 02F8
				<br/>
     R. Modem result codes
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Enter selection (1-9, A-J, R) [Q]uit :
				<br/>
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Note that the command strings can contain the following special
				<br/>
     characters:
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "|"       Sends a carriage return (^M) to the modem.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "^x"      Sends a control character to the modem. (^M can be typed
				<br/>
                    as a | here.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "~"       Performs a half-second delay before sending the next
				<br/>
                    character to the modem.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "^"       Toggles DTR for .25 seconds.
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Each menu option is described in detail below.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          1    This is where you can set the maximum baud rate of your
				<br/>
               modem. If you're locking the COM port, this is the speed
				<br/>
               at which the port will be locked.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          2    This is the COM port that this nodes modem is connected to,
				<br/>
               which can be COM1 through COM64.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          3    This is the command that initializes the modem.  This is
				<br/>
               VERY important, as it tells the modem how to operate under
				<br/>
               the BBS environment.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Words of Advice: If your modem has the ability to store user
				<br/>
                                profiles in its volatile memory, use it.
				<br/>
                                Renegade likes a short init string.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          4    This is the command that Renegade sends to the modem in order
				<br/>
               to answer an incoming call.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          5    This is the command that hangs up the modem.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          6    This is the command that places the modem (and, consequently,
				<br/>
               the phone line) offhook.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          7    This option toggles whether or not the COM port is locked. If
				<br/>
               your modem supports rates above 2400 baud, make sure this
				<br/>
               is set to On.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          8    This option toggles XON/XOFF flow control on and off. (See
				<br/>
               information above about CTS/RTS flow control.  XON/XOFF is
				<br/>
               also known as Software Flow Control.) Pick one or the other,
				<br/>
               but don't use both. The CTS/RTS is the preferable Flow Control.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          9    This option toggles CTS/RTS flow control on or off.  Flow
				<br/>
               control tells the computer or modem when to start and stop
				<br/>
               sending or receiving information to/from the other device.
				<br/>

               If you define this directory, you must create it. Renegade will

               only; the value defined here is what will be shown by the %C
				<br/>
               MCI Code.

				<br/>
               If you need to set the comport to use a different IRQ and
				<br/>
               port address, you must do this through your fossil driver,

     --------------------------------
				<br/>
				<br/>
          A    This setting defines the security level for a full SysOp.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               NOTE: This also defines the level for which the //\\XX global
				<br/>
                     command keys can be set. I highly recommend this be
				<br/>
                     set to u1 instead of s255.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          B    This is the ACS Level that a user must have in order to
				<br/>
               be qualified as a Full Co-Sysop.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          C    This setting defines the security level for a message base
				<br/>
               SysOp.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          D    This setting defines the security level for a file base
				<br/>
               SysOp.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               NOTE: C and D are more or less obsolete these days. With
				<br/>
               the addition of the FILEP and READP menus, a sysop can
				<br/>
               change who has access to what commands. In addition, each
				<br/>
               message base has it's own setting for Sysop ACS. You can
				<br/>
               change the strings as they're defined here, but they don't
				<br/>
               really do anything. :)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          E    This setting defines the security level in which the SysOp
				<br/>
               password must be specified during the logon process.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          F    This is the access needed to add a voting choice when the
				<br/>
               topic is added with "add choices off".
				<br/>
				<br/>
          G    This setting defines the security level required to post
				<br/>
               normal public mail.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          H    This setting is similar to option G, except that it pertains
				<br/>
               to normal Email.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               NOTE: If you set this to a higher ACS than a New User who
				<br/>
               has just applied to the system has, they *will not* be able
				<br/>
               to send a newuser letter to the sysop. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
          I    If a user qualifies for this ACS level, they will be able to
				<br/>
               see the real name or handle on any anonymous public messages.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               The message header would look something like this:

						<br/>
               pertains to normal Email instead of public messages.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
						<br/>
               to post anonymously on ANY message base. If a user meets this
						<br/>
               ACS, it will override the individual anonymous settings for
						<br/>
               each individual message base (the one exception to this is if
						<br/>
               it's set to %; if % is used, then the individual base settings
						<br/>
               will still be honored.) If you use ^ here, then users will be
						<br/>
               able to post anonymously on any public message base, regardless
						<br/>
               of the individual settins.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This setting is similar to option K, except that it deals with
						<br/>
               Email.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
						<br/>
               to see unvalidated files when looking through the file lists.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
						<br/>
               to download unvalidated files.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This setting defines the security level at which upload/
						<br/>
               download ratio checking is turned off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          P    This setting defines the security level at which the post/
						<br/>
               call ratio check is turned off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          R    This setting defines the security level at which file point
						<br/>
               checking is turned off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          S    This setting defines the security level at which uploaded
						<br/>
               files are automatically credited to the uploader.  (This is
						<br/>
               useful to prevent uploading of "garbage" files to balance an
						<br/>
               UL/DL ratio for further downloading.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          T    This setting defines the ACS needed to use MCI codes in the
						<br/>
               teleconference area.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          U    This setting defines the security level at which a user can

               force a chat page with the SysOp when he is not available.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          V    This setting defines the security level at which a user can
						<br/>
               send Netmail to another BBS on a network.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          W    This setting defines the security level at which a user can

						<br/>
               to the other nodes when they log on, and in the node listing

               one that is used while the SysOp is typing.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This goes along with option K, except that it's the user chat
						<br/>
               color.  (In case you're wondering.. the reason there are 2
						<br/>
               different colors for chat is basically so that the SysOp and
						<br/>
               user knows who said what.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This option sets the minimum amount of hard drive space (in K)
						<br/>
               that must be available on the hard drive in order to post a
						<br/>
               message.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    Pretty much the same as option M, except that it deals with the
						<br/>
               minimum amount of free space in order to upload. If less than
						<br/>
               this space is available, uploads will not be permitted.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This option sets the number of days that the SysOp back logs
						<br/>
               are kept.  (Maximum is 15 days.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          P    This option sets the time of inactivity before the WFC screen
						<br/>
               is blanked.  (Screen Saver)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          R    When a user pages the Sysop, and he doesn't answer, the PC
						<br/>
               speaker on his end will continue to emit a very irritating
						<br/>
               sound to let him know someone tried to page him. This option
						<br/>
               defines the number of seconds between the irritating noises.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          S    This option defines the number of calls the BBS has received.
						<br/>
               This number is automatically incremented each time a user
						<br/>
               remotely logs into the BBS.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          T    This option defines the minimum baud rate that can call into
						<br/>
               the BBS. (This is normally used to "lock-out" 300 baud users
						<br/>
               who are too slow to do much.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          U    This option defines the minimum baud rate that can download
						<br/>
               files from the BBS. (See note on option T)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          0-9  These are the F1-F10 SysOp Definable Macros that only the SysOp
						<br/>
               can use on the BBS. If the sysop presses F1 on the local
						<br/>
               keyboard, then what is defined as the F1 macro is what will
						<br/>
               be displayed.

						<br/>
						<br/>
     Enter selection (A-Z,1-3) [Q]uit :
						<br/>
     -------------------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
          A    This option specifies whether or not handles are allowed on
						<br/>
               the system.  (A handle is an alias.  Like CB Radio.) Some
						<br/>
               users like the anonymous aspect of BBSing, but it IS your
						<br/>
               choice.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          B    This option specifies whether or not the user's phone number
						<br/>
               is asked for during the logon process.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          C    This option controls local security protection. When Local
						<br/>
               Security Protection is turned on, the sysop password must be
						<br/>
               entered from the WFC screen in order to do anything (though
						<br/>
               the Q command still works from the WFC screen, regardless
						<br/>
               of whether or not Local Security Protection is on). Also,
						<br/>
               all passwords will be masked on the local display, as if it
						<br/>
               were remote. This is useful if the local computer is located in
						<br/>
               a place where many people might be passing near it. This not
						<br/>
               only protects your user data, but prevents others from possibly
						<br/>
               causing harm to your BBS. All told, if you're the only one
						<br/>
               that ever sits down in front of your computer, it's safe to
						<br/>
               leave this Off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          D    This option specifies whether or not the RENEGADE.OVR file
						<br/>
               is to be accessed from EMS (expanded) memory.  If the overlay
						<br/>
               can't be stored in EMS, Renegade will access the overlay from
						<br/>
               disk as usual. (Accessing the overlay via EMS is *much* faster
						<br/>
               than accessing it from disk.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
               NOTE: As of Renegade vXX-XXX, the overlay will load into
						<br/>
                     XMS if it is available. This can speed things up
						<br/>
                     and free up RAM if you unload your EMS driver.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    This option controls global activity trapping.  If set to
						<br/>
               On, it will log everything every user does to disk. 
						<br/>
               (Trust me, turn this off. The trap file will eat your hard
						<br/>
               drive space very quickly.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    This option specifies whether or not to automatically open
						<br/>
               the chat buffer during a chat session. If On, the entire
						<br/>
               conversation will be recorded in the CHAT.LOG in your
						<br/>
               LOGS directory. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    This option specifies whether or not the auto-message is
						<br/>
               displayed during the logon process.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    If this is On, and any Bulletins have been updated since
						<br/>
               the users last call, this will tell them which bulletins
						<br/>
               have been updated and ask if they'd like to see them. If
						<br/>
               it is turned off, nothing about bulletins will be said
						<br/>
               during login.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    This option specifies whether or not the user's status is
						<br/>
               shown during the logon process. If so, then it will read
						<br/>
               the YOURINFO.ASC present in your MISC directory. If the file
						<br/>
               does not exist, nothing will be displayed. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This option specifies whether or not Renegade's color
						<br/>
               codes will be stripped from the SysOp log.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    This option specifies whether or not the phone should be
						<br/>
               taken off-hook during local logons.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This option will toggle whether or not the messages going
						<br/>
               through teleconferencing should be logged or not.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This option controls the "compression" of file and message
						<br/>
               base numbers.  This option takes a little explaining...
						<br/>
						<br/>
               Say you have ten message bases (1-10), and bases 2, 6 and 9
						<br/>
               are restricted from certain users.  Normally when the list of
						<br/>
               message areas is displayed, those areas are not shown, leaving
						<br/>
               a gap in the listings (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10).  If this option
						<br/>
               is set to on, all the message base numbers are made contiguous
						<br/>
               (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) to the user. They user won't realize that
						<br/>
               they're restricted from seeing something.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    This option specifies whether or not ROM BIOS routines are
						<br/>
               to be used for all local screen output.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This option specifies whether or not IEMSI handshaking
						<br/>
               will take place or not.  IEMSI is simply when the user
						<br/>
               defines certain pieces of information in his terminal
						<br/>
               program such as Real Name, Address and such... it
						<br/>
               basically speeds up the logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          P    If this is on, then the BBS will not accept any new users.
						<br/>
               If it is off, they will be able to apply as normal.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          R    This option defines if Renegade will Swap memory if it shells
						<br/>
               out of the BBS. Renegade tends to default this to Off when
						<br/>
               installed. Trust me, turn it on. :)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          S    This option defines if the BBS will use the Shuttle Logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          T    This option toggles Chat call paging. (After a user pages you,
						<br/>
               the board buzzes you to remind you that the user wants to chat.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          U    This option defines if the time limits are per call or per
						<br/>
               day.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          V    This option defines if most options (some are logon, most
						<br/>
               functions in SysOp menu, etc.) ask for the SysOp password
						<br/>
               before letting you execute the command.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          W    Toggles a random quote in the logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          X    Allows the user to add to the random quotes that are displayed
						<br/>
               at logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          Y    Toggles (default) to use lightbars for the message area listings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          Z    Toggles (default) to use lightbars for the file area listings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          1    This option defines the number of the user that will receive
						<br/>
               "new user" messages.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               NOTE: If you do not wish to have a new user message sent to
						<br/>
                     anyone, select [D]isable.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          2    This option specifies the number of minutes before the bell
						<br/>
               is sounded to alert the user that the system is about to
						<br/>
               "time out".
						<br/>
						<br/>
                NOTE: If you do not wish this to go into effect, select
						<br/>
                      [D]isable
						<br/>
						<br/>
          3    This option specifies the number of minutes that are allowed
						<br/>
               to pass with no activity before the system "times out".
						<br/>
						<br/>
                NOTE: If you do not wish this to go into effect, select
						<br/>
                      [D]isable

          A    This option specifies whether or not upload/download ratio
						<br/>
               checking is active.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          B    This option specifies whether or not a file point file system
						<br/>
               is active.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          C    This option turns the daily download limits on or off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          D    This option toggles if the uploads will be recommented and
						<br/>
               converted to the current file base's archive setting.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    This command works with option H. If this is turned on, the user
						<br/>
               will receive the percentage defined in H of the files file point
						<br/>
               worth everytime the file is downloaded.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    This option will toggle whether or not Renegade will search an
						<br/>
               uploaded file for FILE-ID.DIZ.  (It is a file that describes
						<br/>
               what the file is, no matter what the user enters for
						<br/>
               information.  It is a standard also used by PC Board.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    This option will toggle whether or not Renegade will
						<br/>
               recompress archives when the file is uploaded. (Helpful to
						<br/>
               force Maximum Compression, add a AV stamp, etc.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    This option defines the % of the file's points that is
						<br/>
               rewarded to the uploader whenever the file is downloaded.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    This option defines how many points the user gets per file
						<br/>
               credits they've earned. ie, with the setting above, if a user
						<br/>
               uploaded a file worth 1 file point, they would receive 4.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This option defines what 1 file point is equal to in K.
						<br/>
               (ie: if set to 10k, every 10k of a file will charge the user
						<br/>
               1 file point.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    This option defines the percentage of time that a user is
						<br/>
               refunded after uploading a file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This option defines the file base that is set to "SysOp only".
						<br/>
               This is for SysOp-only uploads which are sent by putting a "\"
						<br/>
               as the first character in the file description.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This option specifies whether or not all uploaded files are

  Chapter 6-I: Offline Mail Configuration
						<br/>
  --------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     Offline Mail is a system where one computer takes messages, compresses
						<br/>
     it to a file, then you transfer it to the other computer, and it is
						<br/>
     processed.  This saves time online for other people to call, and to
						<br/>
     cut down on any phone charges.
						<br/>
     ------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     Offline Mail Configuration

     Enter selection (A-I) [Q]uit :
						<br/>
     -------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
        A       This option is what the name of the QWK packet which is
						<br/>
                created will be called (and what the reply is called.) without
						<br/>
                the QWK or REP extension.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        B       This option is the complete path and filename (without

						<br/>
                extension) of the news file in the QWK file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
                (Note: Renegade does *not* generate a news file; you
						<br/>
                 must either create it yourself, or via third party
						<br/>
                 utility)
						<br/>
						<br/>
        D       This option is the complete path and filename (without

                extension) of the goodbye file in the QWK file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        E       This option is the complete path to where you normally
						<br/>
                have your QWK files and REP files for when you want to read
						<br/>
                the BBS's messages offline with the other mail packets.
						<br/>
                If the file *.QWK already exists, the new packet will be
						<br/>
                renamed to *.QWA, then *.QWB, then *.QWC up to *.QWZ.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        F       This option can be set if you want people to have unlimited
						<br/>
                time for downloading their mail (no matter what the time they
						<br/>
                have left, let them d/l their mail packet).

  Chapter 6-*: String Configuration
						<br/>
  -----------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
    String config is where the customizable prompts, quotes, questions and
						<br/>
    text are located.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  -----------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-*-1:
						<br/>
  -----------
						<br/>
						<br/>
--------------------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
Logon Quote Strings:  These are located in your \RENEGADE\TEXT directory
						<br/>
in the LGNQUOTE.TXT file.   Each quote is seperated via a $.   The logon
						<br/>
quotes must be compiled after any changes for it to take efferct.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
LGNQUOTE example:
						<br/>
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to
						<br/>
laugh at that man.
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp,
						<br/>
because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try
						<br/>
to catch you, because, hey, free dummy.
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
						<br/>
Run LGNQUOTE.EXE to compile these strings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
Renegade now gives you the option to add a tagline to your email
						<br/>
and messages.  The format is as follows.   One message per line
						<br/>
in the file TAGLINE.TXT.  
						<br/>
						<br/>
All's well that ends well - E. A. Poe
						<br/>
All's well that ends well. -Poe.    Bother. -Pooh.
						<br/>
Always avoid the inevitable
						<br/>
Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it.
						<br/>
Always be smarter than the people who hire you.
						<br/>
Always remember where you came from so you can return.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
Run TAGLINE.EXE to compile any new taglines so they can be used.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
A bunch of strings that were previously uneditable in Renegade has
						<br/>
been slowly removed to RGLNG.TXT.
						<br/>
						<br/>
RGLNG.TXT is your main file for most strings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
example:
						<br/>
						<br/>
$End_Chat
						<br/>

						<br/>
$Pause
						<br/>
^4[^0þ Press any key þ^4]@
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
Each string is seperated with a $ and a name.  Do NOT change
						<br/>
these names, only the info on the line(s) between the $'s.

     each entry in the list.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          1    This option specifies whether or not the archive format is
						<br/>
               active.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          2    This option specifies the extension used for files saved in
						<br/>
               the particular archive format.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          3    This option defines the way the board is to view the contents
						<br/>
               of archive files in the current format.
						<br/>
						<br/>
                    /1 - Uses the internal ZIP file viewer
						<br/>
                    /2 - Uses the internal ARC file viewer
						<br/>
                    /3 - Uses the internal ZOO file viewer
						<br/>
                    /4 - Uses the internal LZH file viewer
						<br/>
                    /5 - Uses the internal ARJ file viewer
						<br/>
						<br/>
               If you have defined an archive format that is not supported
						<br/>
               internally, use this option to define the Commandline required
						<br/>
               to view the archive's contents.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          4    This option defines the command line used to create or
						<br/>
               update an archive file using this format.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               If this line is blank, Renegade assumes the file is compressed.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               This is for people who want to test things such as GIF files,
						<br/>
               while leaving the Recompress Archive flag on.  Before, files
						<br/>
               would be deleted because they could not be compressed.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          5    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines
						<br/>
               the Commandline used to extract files from an archive file.
						<br/>
               All rules and restrictions mentioned above also apply.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          6    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines the
						<br/>
               Commandline needed to check the integrity of an archive file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          7    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines the
						<br/>
               Commandline used to add a comment to an archive file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          8    This option defines the ERRORLEVEL value that the archiving
						<br/>
               program returns when an operation has been successfully
						<br/>
               completed.  Most programs return a level of 0.

  Chapter 6-O: Call Allowances Per Day
						<br/>
  ------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of calls allowed per day.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  ------------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-P: UL/DL # of Files Ratio
						<br/>
  ------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of files that a user can download for every file that they
						<br/>
     upload.  If set to 0, this function becomes disabled for that SL.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  -----------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-Q: UL/DL KiloBytes Ratio
						<br/>
  -----------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section

     sets the number of K that a user can download for every K that they
						<br/>
     upload.  If set to 0, this function becomes disabled for that SL.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  --------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-R: Post/Call Ratio
						<br/>
  --------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of posts per call ratio that must be kept in order to have
						<br/>
     a correct PCR. (Helpful if you want to keep people out of the File transfer
						<br/>
     section until they get productive in posting, etc..)
						<br/>
						<br/>
  Some people have gotten confused about this section.  You want to enter the
						<br/>
  number of posts that a user of that Security Level (SL) would need for the ACS
						<br/>
  "ZZ", per 100 calls.  (ie: if this was set to 25, the user would have to post
						<br/>
  25 messages for every 100 calls they make.  if they don't, they won't have ACS
						<br/>
  "ZZ", and therefore can't do anything that you have "ZZ" in.)

						<br/>
						<br/>
          A    Alters the user's name.  If the BBS allows handles, this
						<br/>
               name can be set differently from the user's real name.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          B    Alters the user's real name.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          C    Alters the user's address.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          D    Alters the user's city and state/province.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    Alters the user's postal zip code.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    Alters the comment field if you want to be reminded of something
						<br/>
               about the user.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    Alters the user's answer to the 1st SysOp Definable Question.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    Alters the user's answer to the 2nd SysOp Definable Question.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    Alters the user's answer to the 3rd SysOp Definable Question.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This command toggles the Status of the user:
						<br/>
                1) This command can be set to record every action of a
						<br/>
                   user from logon to logoff.
						<br/>
                2) This command is used to turn auto-chat buffering on.
						<br/>
                3) This command will output the users actions to a separate
						<br/>
                   SysOp log specific to the user.
						<br/>
                4) This command will alert the SysOp when the user logs on
						<br/>
                   the next time.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               The Display next to Status doesn't display the status of
						<br/>
               Chat buffer or SysOp Log, but notifies you if the user is
						<br/>
               Deleted or if they are locked out.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    Alters the configuration of the user's QWK packets.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    Alters the user's security level (SL).
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    Alters the user's download security level (DSL).
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    Allows toggling of the user's AR flags.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               NOTE: AR Flags can get complicated. Unlike AC Flags,
						<br/>
                     AR Flags are *not* predefined, you as the sysop
						<br/>
                     can use them for whatever you please. This is
						<br/>
                     done by ACS checking (see the Fx ACS level in
						<br/>
                     Chapter 3). For example, if I want to set access
						<br/>
                     to my file menu to users only with AR Flag F, I
						<br/>
                     change the access on the file menu via the menu
						<br/>
                     editor to read "FF" (without the quotation marks).
						<br/>
                     After doing this, if a user tries access the file
						<br/>
                     menu, and they do not have AR flag F toggled on, then
						<br/>
                     they will be denied access to the menu. If they do
						<br/>
                     have AR Flag F toggled on, they'll be allowed to access
						<br/>
                     the menu. In this manner, a sysop could pick and choose
						<br/>
                     who has access to the file menu simply by toggling that
						<br/>
                     users flags. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    Allows toggling of the user's AC flags.
						<br/>
						<br/>
            AC Flag Definitions:
						<br/>
						<br/>
               Penalty Flags -

                    caller to have more than one BBS logon in a given
						<br/>
                    day.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               C    Can't page SysOp - Does not allow the caller to use

                    the chat command throughout the BBS.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               V    Posts marked unvalidated - Marks all public messages
						<br/>
                    as "unvalidated" until the SysOp decides to
						<br/>
                    either validate or delete them.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               U    Can't list users
						<br/>
						<br/>
               A    Can't write a AutoMessage.  This command will not allow
						<br/>
                    the user to replace the current AutoMessage with one of
						<br/>
                    their own.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               *    Can't post/send anon. - This flag prevents the caller
						<br/>
                    from being able to post public or Email messages
						<br/>
                    anonymously.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               P    Can't post at all - This flag prevents a user from
						<br/>
                    posting any messages in any message base.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               E    Can't send Email - This flag prevents the caller from
						<br/>
                    sending any Email to another user.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               K    Can't vote - Does not allow the caller to have access
						<br/>
                    to the voting booth.
						<br/>
						<br/>

							<br/>
							<br/>
          6    This is the maximum number of files allowed in a file base.
							<br/>
               If a user tries to upload a file when the maximum number of

               the file base to be newscanned.  Files on the CD-ROM (either
							<br/>
               Batch or Single Download) will be copied to the BBS Temporary
							<br/>
               Directory under the CD directory.  They are automatically

               size and color information about the files in the current base
							<br/>
               when the *8 CmdKey is used.

               area listing regardless of whether or not the user has access
							<br/>
               to that base. If the user lacks access, it will show in the

  Chapter 8-A: Configuring CD-ROM File Areas
							<br/>
  ---------------------
							<br/>
							<br/>
   CD-ROM areas are pretty easy to configure under RG. CD's are a
							<br/>
   nice addition to any BBS. They hold over half a gig of files, and
							<br/>
   unless you play frisbee with them, leave them under heat lamps, or
							<br/>
   practice other destructive little habits, the media will probably
							<br/>
   outlive you. :)
							<br/>
							<br/>
   NOTE: This section will assume that any CD you're adding will have
							<br/>
   all the files in one directory. If the CD you wish to add has more
							<br/>
   than one directory of files on it, repeat these steps for each directory
							<br/>
   on on the CD.
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Adding a CD to your BBS begins by creating a filebase for it. Make sure
							<br/>
   the Download Path is pointing to the CD drive and the directory the
							<br/>
   files are in (ie, if your CD-ROM is drive F: and the files are in BURN,
							<br/>
   set the path to F:\BURN)
							<br/>
							<br/>
   As for the upload path, you have a choice to make. Obviously, you can't
							<br/>
   upload files to the CD. You can still upload files to that filebase,
							<br/>
   they'll be stored in the UL path that you define. If you don't intend
							<br/>
   on storing any files beyond what's already on the CD, then set the UL
							<br/>
   path to the same as the DL path. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Press C to turn the CD-ROM flag on for the area. This is important;
							<br/>
   by turning the C flag on you're telling Renegade to copy the files off
							<br/>
   the CD and onto the local harddisk before transferring them to a
							<br/>
   remote system. I recommend this; downloading from a CD is *slow*, and
							<br/>
   if you're using a disc changer, you really do not want to the discs
							<br/>
   to change in the middle of someones download. :)
							<br/>
							<br/>
   It should look something like this:
							<br/>
							<br/>
         --------------------
							<br/>
         1. Name        : CD #1 [Online] - Renegade Source Code
							<br/>
         2. Filename    : CDROM1
							<br/>
         3. DL/UL path  : E:\RGSRC\ / E:\RGSRC\
							<br/>
         4. ACS req'd   : s50
							<br/>
         5. UL/DL ACS   :  /
							<br/>
         6. Max files   : 2000
							<br/>
         7. Password    :
							<br/>
         8. Arc/cmt type: ZIP/1
							<br/>
            Flags       : --C-
							<br/>
         --------------------
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Next, put the CD into the drive, login, head to your file menu, change
							<br/>
   to the new filebase, and locally upload the files.
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Yes, this is slow. Yes, this is a pain in the ass. Yes, this can consume

   most of your afternoon before you realize it. Pray and hope that the files
							<br/>
   on the CD have FILE_ID.DIZ's or DESC.SDI's, otherwise you have to enter
							<br/>
   the descriptions by hand.
							<br/>
							<br/>
   There is an alternative. If there is a file named FILES.BBS anywhere on
							<br/>
   the CD, you can save yourself alot of pain and trouble. The FILES.BBS
							<br/>
   *should* contain the file descriptions for the files on the CD.

								<br/>
          2    The name of the message files.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          3    Designates the message base type.  Three types are currently
								<br/>
               available:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    Local - Allows the exchange of messages only between
								<br/>
                         the users of the BBS.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    Echomail - Allows the exchange of messages, via a FidoNet
								<br/>
                         type message network system.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    QWKMail - Adds origin lines and tear lines to messages,
								<br/>
                         but does not export or add addresses.  This is for
								<br/>
                         use with the QWK Networking feature.
								<br/>
								<br/>
               When a base is defined as Echomail, you will be prompted for a
								<br/>
               disk drive message path.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          4    The ACS requirements that the user must meet in order to
								<br/>
               access the message base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          5    The user must have this ACS setting in order to post messages on
								<br/>
               this base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          6    This is the ACS setting for users to have "SysOp Commands"
								<br/>
               available to them.  This is helpful for BBS moderators.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          7    This is the maximum number of messages that can be posted on
								<br/>
               the base. (Default is 100.) When the number of messages exceeds
								<br/>
               this limit old posts start getting removed when the base gets
								<br/>
               packed.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          8    This determines the anonymity level of the message base.
								<br/>
               Available anonymity levels are:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (Y)es, anonymous allowed.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (N)o, anonymous not allowed.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (F)orced Anonymous - This automatically makes every
								<br/>
                         post on the base anonymous.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (D)ear Abby - This is for a "Dear Abby" problem
								<br/>
                         solving message base.  A user may post a message
								<br/>
                         under ANY one of these three possibilities:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                              "Problemed User" - Posted by a user who
								<br/>
                                   wants help, but wishes to remain anonymous.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                              "Abby" - Allows another user to respond to a
								<br/>
                                   problem post, with anonymity.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                              User name and number - Allows a caller to
								<br/>
                                   post a problem/suggestion under their
								<br/>
                                   handle and user number.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (A)ny Name - Allows users to post messages using any name
								<br/>
                                   they like.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          9    When active, this will prompt a user for the password which
								<br/>
               must be entered correctly in order to access that message base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          N    Let's you select another node number to use if you are involved
								<br/>
               with 2 of more mail networks. 
								<br/>
								<br/>
          C    Defines the colors used for standard text, quoted text,
								<br/>
               tear, and origin lines for Echomail and Groupmail messages.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          M    Defines the various flag settings used when tossing,
								<br/>
               scanning, and posting Echomail and Groupmail messages.  The
								<br/>
               currently available flags are:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    K - Strip IFNA kludge lines.
								<br/>
                    S - Strip SEEN-BY lines (Echomail only).
								<br/>
                    O - Strip origin lines.
								<br/>
                    T - Add tear and origin lines to posted messages.
								<br/>
                    I - Sets the message base to Internet Status
								<br/>
								<br/>
          O    Defines the origin line placed at the bottom of Echomail and
								<br/>
               Groupmail messages.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          Q    Exits the message base editor.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          T    Allows you to edit the base's flag set.  
								<br/>
								<br/>
               Flag Definitions:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                R   Real Names Flag: If active, real names are stored in the
								<br/>
                    "From:" and "To:" fields of each message.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                U   Unhidden Flag: If active, it will display a message base
								<br/>
                    in an area listing regardless if the user has access to
								<br/>
                    that base. If the user does not have access to the base,
								<br/>
                    the name of the base will be shown without a base number.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                A   Strip 8-bit ASCII/ANSI Flag: If active, ANSI codes and
								<br/>
                    8-bit ASCII characters (127-255) are removed from messages
								<br/>
                    before they are posted.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                P   Private Messages Flag: If active, this allows private
								<br/>
                    posts to be allowed in the message base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                     NOTE: If a Private message is posted within an echomail
								<br/>
                           base, it will still be sent out with the rest of
								<br/>
                           the mail. The Private flag affects local status
								<br/>
                           only.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                F   Forced Flag: If active, this will disable the Q command,
								<br/>
                    making the base a "Mandatory Reading" base to read every
								<br/>
                    message.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                Q   Add a tagline to end of message in this base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          P    Defines the QWK packet conference that this base is permanently
								<br/>
               assigned.  Normally when created, this will be equal to the
								<br/>
               base number.  If a base below this one is deleted however, the
								<br/>
               QWK replies will always be brought into this conference because
								<br/>
               of the permanent number.

     They are defined as:
																<br/>
																<br/>
          !    This option allows you to define the type and availability
																<br/>
               of the current protocol.  The available types are:
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    Active - The protocol is active
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    Batch - The protocol will transfer multiple files with
																<br/>
                         one command.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    Resume - The protocol will transfer one file, and
																<br/>
                         resume the transfer where it left off (if the
																<br/>
                         previous transfer was aborted).
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    Bi-Directional - The protocol will transfer files in
																<br/>
                         both directions at the same time.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    Reliable - The protocol should only be available to
																<br/>
                         those callers who connect with a reliable connection.
																<br/>
                         (Error Correction Connect...)
																<br/>
																<br/>
          1    This option defines the command keys required to select the
																<br/>
               protocol and a description that will be displayed when
																<br/>
               requested.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          2    This option defines the ACS requirements that the user must have
																<br/>
               to use the protocol.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          3    This option defines the name of the file that holds the
																<br/>
               result log of a file transfer operation.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          4    This option defines the names of the permanent result log
																<br/>
               files for upload and download transfers.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          5    This option defines the commands required to perform file
																<br/>
               uploading and downloading.
																<br/>
																<br/>
               When pressed, you will be asked which command (upload or
																<br/>
               download) to define.  You are then asked which type of command
																<br/>
               it will be.  The four different command types are as follows:
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    (C)ommand - The entry is assigned to a special
																<br/>
                         function.
																<br/>
                         Ascii - The selected file will be transferred to
																<br/>
                              the remote user via ASCII transfer.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Batch - The entry will not actually transfer a

																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Edit - The selected file's directory entry is edited
																<br/>
                              and the information can be changed.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Next - The selected file is skipped and the next

																<br/>
																<br/>
                    (E)xternal - Allows you to define the actual DOS
																<br/>
                         Commandline used with the protocol driver.  Refer to
																<br/>
                         the above list to determine the correct Commandline.
																<br/>

          6    This option toggles if the error result codes defined in option
																<br/>
               7 mean a good or bad transfer.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          7    This option defines the result codes (for both uploading and
																<br/>
               downloading) returned by the protocol driver after completing
																<br/>
               transmission of a file.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          E    This option defines the command that sets up an environment
																<br/>
               string for those programs that require environment variables to
																<br/>
               be set up in certain ways for a transfer log.  For example:
																<br/>
               "SET DSZLOG=%T" would set the DSZ.COM temporary result log
																<br/>
               filename to the name defined in option 3.  If no environment
																<br/>
               setup is necessary, this string should be set to NULL ("").
																<br/>
																<br/>
               *IMPORTANT*:   If you define a command with this option, make
																<br/>
                              sure to define it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE!
																<br/>
																<br/>
          I    This option defines the name of the file in which Renegade
																<br/>
               will store the filenames to be transferred in a batch
																<br/>
               transfer.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          C    This option defines the maximum number of characters allowed
																<br/>
               on the DOS Commandline.  (Default is 128, which is the normal
																<br/>
               allowable DOS size.)
																<br/>
																<br/>
          P    This option defines the positions, on a single line of the
																<br/>
               temporary result log, of the filename and return status of the
																<br/>
               transfer.

  Chapter 11-B: Linking Menu Commands
																	<br/>
  ------------------
																	<br/>
																	<br/>
     When a user activates a menu command, Renegade executes all of the
																	<br/>
     commands which have the command letters which were entered by the user.
																	<br/>
     If two different commands both have the same command letters in them,
																	<br/>
     both commands are executed in the order they are in the menu.
																	<br/>
																	<br/>
     When linking commands together, remember to put a description only on
																	<br/>
     the first command in the link, and set the rest to null.  This stops
																	<br/>
     Renegade from displaying the command several times on the generic menu.

																	<br/>
  Chapter 11-C: Menu System Commands (Command Keys)
																	<br/>
  -------------------------
																	<br/>
																	<br/>
     The Command Key (CmdKey)'s are 2 letter codes which make Renegade do a
																	<br/>
     certain function. (<> means Optional, [] means required, {} means pick
																	<br/>
     one. None means there is no Option available for that command.)

																																																															<CR>Redisplay menu - Redisplays the listing of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          (D)elete - This will allow you to delete an unwanted event.

																																																																<br/>
          (I)nsert - This will insert another event into the list.

          !    This determines whether or not the event is active.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          1    This describes the event.  (Up to 80 characters)
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          2    This is the type of event that will be executed.  There are
																																																																<br/>
               six choices:
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    ACS - Enables only certain callers who have the correct
																																																																<br/>
                         security settings to access the BBS at a certain time
																																																																<br/>
                         of the day.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Chat - Not implemented yet.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    DOS - Shells to the DOS level and executes files defined
																																																																<br/>
                           in the Event Data.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    External - This requires a batch file for execution, which
																																																																<br/>
                         is used to detect an ERRORLEVEL value.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Pack - This event packs the message bases by removing
																																																																<br/>
                         all deleted messages and adjusting the number of
																																																																<br/>
                         messages in each base to conform to the maximum
																																																																<br/>
                         limit set in the message base editor.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Sort - This event sorts the file bases by scanning the
																																																																<br/>
                         directories and sorting by name.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          3    This field will vary with the type of event being executed.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    DOS - The name of the program to be run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    External - The ERRORLEVEL value to be used when the BBS
																																																																<br/>
                         quits to DOS.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    ACS - The ACS setting that users must have.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    All others - Not used; the event data field will be
																																																																<br/>
                         ignored.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          4    This is the time before an event that the BBS will become busy.
																																																																<br/>
               If a user is online, their online time is adjusted for the
																																																																<br/>
               event.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          5    This is the time of day that the particular scheduled event
																																																																<br/>
               will occur.  It is defined in the 24-hour format.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          6    This field determines whether or not the modem will be made
																																																																<br/>
               busy during the scheduled event.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          7    This tells if the event is "Hard" or "Soft".  Hard events
																																																																<br/>
               will make Renegade shorten a user's time online if it will
																																																																<br/>
               keep them on longer then when the event will run.  Soft events
																																																																<br/>
               wait for the user to logoff before the event is run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          8    This field determines if the BBS should run the event if it
																																																																<br/>
               missed it the last time it was supposed to be run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          9    This field sets the number of days since the event was last
																																																																<br/>
               run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          A    These are the days of either the regular week, or the month,
																																																																<br/>
               that the scheduled event will occur.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Weekly - Event will occur at least once every week.  A
																																																																<br/>
                    bar with the current days active will be displayed as
																																																																<br/>
                    follows:
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                              Current: SMTWTFS
																																																																<br/>
                                      [       ]
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Modify by entering "X"'s under the days the event is to be
																																																																<br/>
                    active.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Monthly - This will occur only one day in the month, and
																																																																<br/>
                            is modified by entering the day it is to be run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          B    This field determines which node will run the event.  0 means
																																																																<br/>
               the first free node will run it.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          [    This will jump back one entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          ]    This will move forward one entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          F    This will move to the first entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          L    This will move to the last entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          J    This will jump to a specified entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          Q    Saves all entries in the list of events and returns to the
																																																																<br/>
               main editor screen.

 Chapter 15 - Mini-DOS Environment
<br/>																																																																				<br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
        Mini-DOS is a small, compact version of the DOS Commandline.  When
																																																																				<br/>
        you enter this area, you will see something like:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
          E:\RENEGADE>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
        where E:\RENEGADE is your BBS Home directory.  The commands available
																																																																				<br/>
        here are:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         CD            Normal DOS Change Directory Command
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         CLS           Normal DOS Clear Screen Command
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         CONVERT       This command will convert an archived file to another
																																																																				<br/>
                       archive format.  The proper format for the command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       CONVERT FILENAME.EXT XTN
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       where FILENAME.EXT is the full drive:\path\filename
																																																																				<br/>
                       with the correct archive extension of the archive you
																																																																				<br/>
                       want to convert (ie: RENEGADE.ZIP).  XTN is the archive
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension that you want to convert the original file to
																																																																				<br/>
                       (ie: ARJ). The archive type you want to convert to
																																																																				<br/>
                       must be defined in the Archive Configuration.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         COPY          Normal DOS Copy Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DEL           Normal DOS Delete Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DIR           This command will provide a short DOS directory.  The
																																																																				<br/>
                        use is the same as the normal DOS Directory Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DIRSIZE       This command will provide the amount of space that a
																																																																				<br/>
                       given filetype takes up.  The usage is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         DIRSIZE FILETYPE[.EXT]
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       FILETYPE is a valid DOS filename, EXT is an optional
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension.  Wildcards are allowed.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       "DIRSIZE *.ZIP" shows the total size of all the ZIP
																																																																				<br/>
                       files, while "DIRSIZE *" will show the total size of
																																																																				<br/>
                       all the files that don't have an extension.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DISKFREE      This command will show the amount of space free on the
																																																																				<br/>
                       current drive.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         EDIT          This command will pop up the old Renegade Editor, which
																																																																				<br/>
                       is not unlike the DOS command EDLIN.  If no file is
																																																																				<br/>
                       specified, the file is then asked for.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         EXT           This command will allow the command after it (ie:
																																																																				<br/>
                       EXT DIR) to pass to DOS directly, not relying on
																																																																				<br/>
                       MiniDOS. Be very careful of who has access to MiniDOS.
																																																																				<br/>
                       Anyone can use this command to format your harddrive,
																																																																				<br/>
                       deltree your root directory, or run a virus they've
																																																																				<br/>
                       just uploaded.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         EXIT          Normal DOS EXIT Command which will return you to
																																																																				<br/>
                       Renegade.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         HELP or ?     This command will up the DOSHELP.* file as a Help
																																																																				<br/>
                       me file.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         MD            Normal DOS Make Directory Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         MOVE          This command will copy a file or a group of files
																																																																				<br/>
                       and then will delete the original files.  The proper
																																																																				<br/>
                       format for this command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         MOVE FILESPEC.EXT DESTINATION
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         RD            Normal DOS Remove Directory Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         RECEIVE       This command will tell Renegade to receive a file from
																																																																				<br/>
                       the remote computer.  The full command is just
																																																																				<br/>
                       "RECEIVE".  After pressing enter, Renegade will prompt
																																																																				<br/>
                       for a protocol, and if the protocol is a non-batch
																																																																				<br/>
                       protocol, Renegade will prompt for a filename.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         REN           Normal DOS Rename File Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         SEND          This command is the opposite of receive, as it will
																																																																				<br/>
                       allow the remote computer to receive a file that is
																																																																				<br/>
                       sent from Renegade.  No filespecs are required for the
																																																																				<br/>
                       command.  The filename is asked for and then the
																																																																				<br/>
                       protocol.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         TYPE          Normal DOS Type Command. (If in Renegade, you have a
																																																																				<br/>
                       page pause, the file you are typing will be paused.)
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         UNZIP         This command will extract the files from an archive
																																																																				<br/>
                       file (Not just ZIP files, any archive type defined in
																																																																				<br/>
                       the Archive Configuration can be extracted with this
																																																																				<br/>
                       command). The proper format for this command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         UNZIP FILENAME.EXT [OPTIONAL]
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       FILENAME.EXE is the FULL path and filename with
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension of the archive.  [OPTIONAL] is any optional
																																																																				<br/>
                       information that should be passed to the Un-Archiver,
																																																																				<br/>
                       such as destination, file to extract, etc. 
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         VER           This command will just notify you that you are in the
																																																																				<br/>
                       Renegade DOS Emulator.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         VIEW         This command will use the Renegade Internal File lister
																																																																				<br/>
                      and will list the files inside an archive.  The proper
																																																																				<br/>
                      use for this command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                        INF FILENAME
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                      VIEW will search for wildcards for the extension. In
																																																																				<br/>
                      order to see an archives interior with VIEW, that
																																																																				<br/>
                      archive type must have been defined in the Archive
																																																																				<br/>
                      Configuration.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                      NOTE: The default DOSHELP.ASC 
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         ZIP           This command is the opposite of the UNZIP command.  It
																																																																				<br/>
                       has the same format however:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         ZIP FILENAME.EXT FILE1.EXT [FILE2.EXT ...]
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       FILENAME.EXT is the full path and filename with
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension, FILE1.EXT is the full path and filename
																																																																				<br/>
                       for the first file to be archived.  [FILE2.EXT ...]
																																																																				<br/>
                       is any other files you want to stick in the archive.
																																																																				<br/>
                       The archive type you're compressing to must be defined
																																																																				<br/>
                       in the Archive Configuration.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<X>:          
																																																																					<X> = Drive Letter: Normal DOS Change Drive command.
																																																																						<br/>
                       ie - C: changes to the C drive, D: to the drive, and so
																																																																						<br/>
                       on.

  Chapter 16-A: How They're Made
																																																																						<br/>
  ---------------
																																																																						<br/>
																																																																						<br/>
     Infoform questionnaires are text files with certain commands that only
																																																																						<br/>
     have meaning to the BBS.  The questionnaire is stored in the MISC
																																																																						<br/>
     directory, in a file with the extension .INF, .INA or .INV (No Emulation,
																																																																						<br/>
     ANSI Emulation, or Avatar Emulation, respectively.)  When users answer
																																																																						<br/>
     the question(s), their answers are also stored in the MISC directory, in
																																																																						<br/>
     a file with the extension ".ASW".  Answers from other users are appended
																																																																						<br/>
     to the end of the answer file.

Alright!  Only a few more questions to go before you can logon.  Please
																																																																						<br/>
answer the questions, as they are essential for Validation and just as a
																																																																						<br/>
security measure.  Don't worry though....  It's not a test. (it's a quiz..)

																																																																						<br/>
     but beginning with a ":" character, and are followed by a string of
																																																																						<br/>
     characters which define the label name.  Everything else is treated as

---------------------------------------</b>
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     Certain errors while Renegade is online cause it to exit back to DOS.
																																																																																																			<br/>
     Whenever this occurs, the screen image is sent to a file called
																																																																																																			<br/>
     ERROR.LOG in your main BBS directory, along with certain pieces of
																																																																																																			<br/>
     information such as the time, date, error number, BBS version, the user
																																																																																																			<br/>
     who was on and what baud rate they were on at.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     A message is also sent to the SysOp log, and the user's screen when a
																																																																																																			<br/>
     error occurs.  If a error does occur in Renegade, please report it to
																																																																																																			<br/>
     either your local support hub, or one of the Renegade Alpha sites.  Please
																																																																																																			<br/>
     send along the information at the top of the section where the error is in
																																																																																																			<br/>
     the ERROR.LOG file.

																																																																																																			<br/>
                v5-11 Exp, the OY command key has been removed. Copy the
																																																																																																			<br/>
                YOURINFO.ASC included in this archive to your MISC directory
																																																																																																			<br/>
                and change OY to -F in all your menus, and change #6. Options

																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     Renegade looks for certain extensions when displaying files out of the
																																																																																																			<br/>
MISC directory. Which file is displayed depends on the extension (.xxx) and
																																																																																																			<br/>
the users emulation. The extensions are defined as follows:
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     ASC - This generally denotes a plain text file. It can contain color
																																																																																																			<br/>
           codes which are displayed to users in any emulation mode.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     ANS - This denotes a file saved in ANSI and will be displayed to users
																																																																																																			<br/>
           who have ANSI emulation or above.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 AN1-AN9 - If a file with the extension of .AN1 exists, Renegade will
																																																																																																			<br/>
           pick and display a random file. For example; During the logon
																																																																																																			<br/>
           sequence, WELCOME.ANS is displayed. If WELCOME.AN1 exists,
																																																																																																			<br/>
           Renegade will randomnly choose which file file to display.
																																																																																																			<br/>
           This can go on from AN1 to AN9, allowing you to define up to
																																																																																																			<br/>
           ten files (ANS counts as well) of which Renegade will choose
																																																																																																			<br/>
           and display one of them.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 A0S-A6S - These files are displayed on different days of the week, ranging
																																																																																																			<br/>
           from 0:Sunday to 6:Saturday.They can be used in conjunction with the
																																																																																																			<br/>
           random files, too. (WELCOME.A01 for example, means the first (1)
																																																																																																			<br/>
           random ANSI displayed on Sundays).
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     AVT - This denotes a file saved in Avatar, and will be displayed to
																																																																																																			<br/>
           users who have Avatar emulation or above. If a user selects Avatar
																																																																																																			<br/>
           as their emulation, and no .AVT files exist, Renegade will fall
																																																																																																			<br/>
           back and display ANSI files instead. If no .ANS files are found,
																																																																																																			<br/>
           it will fall back to .ASC.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 AV1-AV9 - Avatar follows the same guidelines for random files that ANSI
																																																																																																			<br/>
           does, only with AV1-AV9 as the valid extensions.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     RIP - This extension denotes a file saved in RIP format (see Glossary
																																																																																																			<br/>
           of Terms). RIP files are forced to display, even in expert
																																																																																																			<br/>
           mode. If a user selects RIP as their emulation, and no .RIP
																																																																																																			<br/>
           files exist, it will fall back to Avatar, then Ansi, and then
																																																																																																			<br/>
           to .ASC if necessary.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 RI1-RI9 - RIP follows the same guidelines for random files that ANSI
																																																																																																			<br/>
           does, only with RI1-RI9 as the valid extensions.

 Chapter 20 - Teleconference<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
<br/>
Teleconference Notes: All of the commands in this section that have username<br/>
options (like /MSG, /EJECT, etc.) can have partial usernames. Ex: /PRIVATE Adr<br/>
will send a private message to an online user with A,d, and r as the first<br/>
part of their handle.<br/><br/>
As of v98-101b, the Teleconference commands changed in syntax. They've been<br/>
expanded from their former single letter commands (/P to /PRIVATE for example).<br/>
The WHATSNEW wasn't entirely correct in the listed changes for Teleconference.<br/>
The following mistakes were made in the WHATSNEW regarding the changes to<br/>
Teleconferencing:<br/><br/>
A) The maximum number of global channels is erroneously reported as 255.<br/>
The true maximum number is 32767.<br/><br/>
B) The /REGISTRY command was omitted from the WHATSNEW, but is documented<br/>
below.<br/><br/>

Global Channels:             You may or may not be wondering what a Global<br/>
                             Channel is. When you join a Global Channel<br/>
                             (1-32767), any message sent on that channel will<br/>
                             be displayed to everyone on the channel wherever<br/>
                             they are on the BBS (the exceptions are if a<br/>
                             member of the channel is in a Door or<br/>
                             transferring files, in which case the messages<br/>
                             will be displayed when the door is exited, or the<br/>
                             transfer complete). Global Messages are sent via<br/>
                             the /MSG command while in a chat room.<br/><br/>

  Chapter 20-B: Predefined Actions (ACTIONS.LST)<br/>
 ------------------------<br/><br/>
        The Teleconferencing Action File is a file named ACTIONS.LST in your<br/>
DATA directory which will have pre-defined actions like the "/a" command, but<br/>
without the "/a" use.<br/><br/>
  The format is:<br/><br/>
        [KEYWORD]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWN TO USER]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWN TO ALL BUT RECEIVER]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWS TO ALL IF THERE IS NO RECEIVER]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWN TO RECEIVER]<br/><br/>
  The 2 MCI codes that are for this file only are %S and %R, which stand for<br/>
  Sender and Receiver, respectively.  A sample file:<br/><br/>
       -----------<br/>
       kick<br/>
       ...  and the kick is good!<br/>
       %S just kicked %R square in the butt!<br/>
       %S is kicking blindly!<br/>
       %S just kicked you square in the butt!<br/>
       laugh<br/>
       Hahahahahahahahhahah!!!<br/>
       %S is laughing at %R!<br/>
       %S just burst out laughing!<br/>
       %S is pointing at you and laughing!<br/>
       punch<br/>
       Ouch!  That's smarts!<br/>
       %S just punched %R right in the face!<br/>
       %S is punching blindly!<br/>
       %S just punched you right in the face!<br/>
       -----------<br/><br/>
  If you enter "kick slammin" for example, %S is replaced with your handle,<br/>
  and %R is replaced with "slammin".<br/><br/>
  ---------------------------<br/>
  Chapter 20-C: External Programs through Teleconference<br/>
  ---------------------------<br/><br/>
       Teleconference now allows users to execute external programs via<br/>
       a special type of action format.  The first part of the action is<br/>
       an ":EXECx PROGRAM", where x is the drop file type and PROGRAM<br/>
       is the name of the program or batch file to run.<br/><br/>
       Sample format:<br/>
       -----------<br/>
       TW<br/>
       :EXECG TW.BAT<br/>
BLANK-><br/>
       %S|15 is going to play TradeWars!<br/>
BLANK-><br/><br/>
       It is imperitive that you leave in necessary blanks!<br/><br/><br/>
