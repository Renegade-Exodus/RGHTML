    FREE!!  From the Renegade BBS Dev Team
------------------------------------------------

RGBOT will work with ANY DOS based BBS that uses
NetFOSS and Net2BBS to run via Telnet,  not just
Renegade BBS.

The User will have to press <ESC> twice in order
for  the program to  drop  out and load the BBS.
If any other key  is pressed, it will hang up on
the  user/bot.  Thus  stopping  those  annonying
Bots from trying to gain access and  clogging up
your BBS nodes.

Updated in v0.40 :  A 30 Second Countdown Timer,
and Color. Selectable ANSI screens for Time Out,
Hang up and Loading the BBS. All configurable to
the SysOp.

A FOSSIL driver IS required for this to operate.

 ============================================================================
			<br/>
                    U - Updated     A - Added     F - Fixed
			<br/>
 ============================================================================


			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Fixed bug where new ONELINERS would not display if a
			<br/>
         datafile was remade from scratch and there were not a
			<br/>
         total of 10 ONELINERS present in the original data file.
			<br/>
         Before you would have to save 10 entries to the ONELINER
			<br/>
         before anything would start to display.  This has now
			<br/>
         been corrected.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Renegade no longer sets the USERNAME as a blank field if
			<br/>
         you were to hit ENTER when trying to change your username
			<br/>
         on the BBS.  New RGLNG.TXT entry has been added to account
			<br/>
         for this as well.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Strings added to RGLNG for the "Scanning for your new
			<br/>
         mail." and other strings related to this.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  User Editor now uses standard prompts for editing
			<br/>
         instead of using any pre-defined strings made in RGLNG that
			<br/>
         were intended for the NEWUSER INFO MENU & PERSONAL MENU.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  SysOp Window toggle back at ALT-S since SysOp Split
			<br/>
         Screen chat is now a toggle in the system config.  ALT-A
			<br/>
         still works as well for now.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Added %EP (Empty Pause) MCI Code.  This is for SysOps
			<br/>
         or users that want to make their own PAUSE prompt without
			<br/>
         using the system deinfed one.  Just write your Pause Prompt
			<br/>
         and on the next line input the MCI Code %EP.  (Work in
			<br/>
         progress.)

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  SysOp Password prompt will no longer have an input
			<br/>
         field as part of the string.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Color codes right before the @ sign was not displaying for
			<br/>
         Logon and Password strings.  This has now been corrected.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Renegade will no longer prompt to save a blank string.
			<br/>
         It will now revert to the string before the change was made.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Scrolling Text File Viewer.  Work in progress, but it's
			<br/>
         a start and it works.  Right now, ASCII text only works.  Will
			<br/>
         add more complex features as we work on this.

			<br/>
			<br/>
         New MENUCMD:    VI - Scrolling Text File Viewer

			<br/>
			<br/>
         Works the same as -F.  Whatever you put in the options field
			<br/>
         will be displayed, only with the VI CMD Key you can scroll
			<br/>
         UP and DOWN.

			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Bug in Renemail which would cause a large swap file
			<br/>
         to be created if a certain type of Fido stye message was
			<br/>
         imported.  This has now been corrected and checked for.
			<br/>
			<br/>

     A.  More Strings external.  SysOp In/Out and Multinode
			<br/>
         chat availble/unavailable.
			<br/>

     F.  Oneliners will now show [ANONYMOUS] if the person
			<br/>
         who wrote the oneliner is deleted from the userbase.
			<br/>

     F.  Miscellaneous Cleanup and Color fixes.

			<br/>
============================================================================
			<br/>
                    U - Updated     A - Added     F - Fixed
			<br/>
 ============================================================================
			<br/>
			<br/>
    A.  Not really a Renegade Fix, but added Lee Woodridge to the
			<br/>
        Renegade Development Team.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    A.  Added internal OneLiner Program.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        New Files :
			<br/>
			<br/>
          ONELH.* - Oneliners Header (Optional)
			<br/>
          ONELM.* - Oneliners Middle (Required!!)
			<br/>
          ONELT.* - Oneliners Footer (Optional)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        ONELM.* MCI Codes :
			<br/>
			<br/>
         ~AN (Anon - Yes/No)           ~AT (Anon - True/False)
			<br/>
         ~DA (Date Added)              ~OL (The Oneliner)
			<br/>
         ~RN (Record Number)           ~U# (User ID with '#')
			<br/>
         ~U1 (User ID without '#')     ~UN (User Name)
			<br/>
         ~UL (User Name Lowercase)
			<br/>
         ~US (First 2 Letters of Username - iNiQUiTY Style)
			<br/>
         ~UU (First 2 letters of username lowercase)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        New MENUCMD Keys For OneLiners:
			<br/>
			<br/>
            1L - Display Oneliner (Header/Footer & all Oneliners)
			<br/>
			<br/>
            1R - Display Random line from Oneliner File
			<br/>
			<br/>
    F.  Local file upload bug.  Before when uploading locally with
			<br/>
        the FU command key after 1 upload it would stop and you would
			<br/>
        have to repeat the process.  It somehow become broken over
			<br/>
        the years and no one said anything.   Now it will upload all
			<br/>
        files without stopping if a *.* is entered for the filename.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    F.  When a file was moved, if it was a dupe, the file wasn't moved
			<br/>
        but the description was.  This is no longer the case.  If the
			<br/>
        file is a dupe, nothing is moved.  This prevents dupe file
			<br/>
        descriptions.  
			<br/>
			<br/>
    F.  The (~TO) MCI Code in the LASTM.ASC file would display a random
			<br/>
        number when viewed while the user was still online.  This has
			<br/>
        now been updated to show " - " until the user logs off and
			<br/>
        the correct time online will be shown by this MCI code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    A.  New MCI Code - %XYaa;bb% (aa=01-80 Left to right) and
			<br/>
        (bb=01-25 Top to Bottom).  Allows format positioning of the
			<br/>
        cursor without the need of having your ANSI menu file do it,
			<br/>
        for you.  Say you wanted the word "Hello!" to appear in the
			<br/>
        middle of the screen, it would be used as such:
			<br/>
			<br/>
            %XY40;12%Hello!
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The above would move the cursor to space 40, line 12, and put
			<br/>
        your text of "Hello!" starting there.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    U.  The Auto Message is now configurable.  It is like the oneliner,
			<br/>
        last caller, user list, etc.   It has a header, main, and a
			<br/>
        footer file in the MISC directory.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The auto message is now saved as "AUTOM.ASC" instead of
			<br/>
        "AUTO.ASC" to make it conform to the rest of the code base.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        New Files :
			<br/>
			<br/>
          AUTOH.* - Auto Message Header (Optional)
			<br/>
          AUTOM.* - (Can be made, but automagically made when a auto)
			<br/>
                    (message is created.  This is your auto message.)
			<br/>
          AUTOT.* - Auto Message Footer (Optional)
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Disabled Forgot password response for Co-SyOp and above.
			<br/>
         This would prevent someone from trying to logon as the SysOp
			<br/>
         and trying the forgot password question answer and resetting
			<br/>
         it so they can logon as the SysOp.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Can now scroll through the node settings without having to
			<br/>
         load each node seperately.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Added System Config Menu Option (N). SysOp Macros.  They were
			<br/>
         moved from another submenu to make a more cleaner look and easier
			<br/>
         to find.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Removed System Config and File Area Editors strings from
			<br/>
         the language files to prevent unwanted access.  Also removed the
			<br/>
         MCI codes that ran these menus (which would've caused a problem
			<br/>
         in certain instances.)
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  YES/NO LightBar Choice options added to the YES/NO Prompt MENUCMDs.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Split Screen Chat now auto scrolls and stays within it's
			<br/>
         borders.  Also added help commands that are listed in the center
			<br/>
         of the chat screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  When the SysOp breaks into chat via a "Chat Page" with the
			<br/>
         SpaceBar the split screen chat will auto load.  Otherwise, the
			<br/>
         normal line chat will be used.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         Chat commands are as follows:
			<br/>
                 ALT-C - Line Chat      ALT-S - Split Screen Chat
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Teleconference strings are now located within the RGLNG
			<br/>
         text file instead of the Node setup options screen in the system
			<br/>
         configuration section.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  RENEGADE.EXE /? now shows what command line parameters are
			<br/>
         available to run along with a short message of what each does.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  All strings are now combined into RGLNG.TXT.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  New MENUCMD  *T  to toggle SysOp Chat Availability without
			<br/>
         the use of the SCROLL LOCK key.   Also, new MCI Code %SA to show
			<br/>
         if the sysop is avaliable or not.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Removed more strings from Renegade and added them to
			<br/>
         RGLNG.TXT for more editing for the SysOp.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Redid NewUser Toggle Questions Menu to add all toggles
			<br/>
         in one place.  Remember to clear your all of your toggles after
			<br/>
         you upgrade so the new changes will take effect.  Cmd Key of *
			<br/>
         will do this for you.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  User #0 (Default account) can now be cleared for all user
			<br/>
         options.  Cmd Key of $ will allow you to clear out which
			<br/>
         fields you want to be blank instead of having a "." or some
			<br/>
         random text in the user data file. This is also a good idea to
			<br/>
         do once you upgrade as the forgot password question more than
			<br/>
         likely has a space in it's field and more than likely won't
			<br/>
         work until you clear the prompt with the $ cmd key.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Updated OP Menu CMD options.  Be sure to change these in
			<br/>
         your NEWINFO menu and PERSONAL info menus or else what you
			<br/>
         have listed won't match what it does. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         New OP Menu CMD Options:
			<br/>
			<br/>
                1  Handle
			<br/>
                2  Real Name
			<br/>
                3  Country
			<br/>
                4  Address
			<br/>
                5  City, State
			<br/>

			<br/>
               11  SysOp Defined Question #2
			<br/>
               12  SysOp Defined Question #3
			<br/>
               13  Password
			<br/>
               14  Forgot Password Question Answer
			<br/>
               15  Terminal Emulation
			<br/>
               16  ANSI Color Toggle
			<br/>
               17  Color Scheme

			<br/>

			<br/>
               22  Expert Mode
			<br/>
               23  Lightbars Toggle
			<br/>
               24  Editor Toggle
			<br/>
               25  Mailbox Toggle
			<br/>
               26  QWK Configuration
			<br/>
               27  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
               28  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
               29  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
               30  * UNUSED *
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Updated SysOp LOG Output.  Now shows a bit more info on
			<br/>
         what the user was doing while online.  Such as what menus
			<br/>
         were accessed (along with menu titles & numbers) and a time
			<br/>
         stamp on when things were accessed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Finally tracked down bug that would lock up a newscan
			<br/>
         if you had more than 255 files in a base.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  New MCI Code %OL -- Light Bars On/Off.  This replaces
			<br/>
         the file and message light bar mci codes.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  Fixed bug that allowed the user to Email deleted users.
			<br/>
         Co-SysOp and higher can still email (for what reason, testing?)
			<br/>
         deleted users.  A Prompt will ask if you wish to or not.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Added Several Email Error strings to RGLNG
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Top 10 Files Listing now asks if you would like to
			<br/>
         download one of these files from the menu.  If you select YES
			<br/>
         you will be given the option to download file 1-10.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  More strings added to RGLNG.TXT file to edit for your
			<br/>
         pleasure. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
     F.  User Record now correctly updates stats when a user
			<br/>
         dowloads or uploads a file.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     U.  Increased MAX system menus to 200 from 100.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A.  Added additional Sub-Menus to System Toggles in
			<br/>
         System Config.

			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated Renegade Booting to now NOT show all the debug code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated WFC Screen and removed the "total space free" option as

    as well and moved all options down to give a beter uniform look.

			<br/>
         ALT-A is now SysOp line ON/OFF

			<br/>
			<br/>
    The above CTRL-HOME options were changed in v1.22 but the Help screen
			<br/>
    was never updated.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated some miscellaneous display files that were maybe not
			<br/>

			<br/>
     %ON - If Node Is Available For Chat (ON/OFF Answer)

			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Removed/Added some line spacing after certain hard coded internal
			<br/>
    displays and prompts.  Gives things a cleaner look than being jumbled
			<br/>
    together when they are displayed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Code Cleanup on Renemail.  Nothing major, tweaked the UI a little and
			<br/>
    did a color change.  Couldn't stand that Blue Background anymore.
			<br/>
    Also updated the copyright notice.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. New Renegade BBS WWW Home - http://www.rgbbs.info
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Finally noticed the "New Scanning of Files" prompt was not exported
			<br/>
    to RGLNG.TXT.  Added this option, so you can now change your
			<br/>
    "Scanning File Base Name ... " prompt to more closely match your BBS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    Will include a new RGLNG.TXT file in the update, or you can just add
			<br/>
    the option to the end of your RGLNG.TXT file called NEW_FILE_SCANNING
			<br/>
			<br/>
    $New_File_Scanning
			<br/>
    %CLScanning ... [%FB - %HM]@
			<br/>
    $
			<br/>
			<br/>
 U. Updated RGLNG.EXE to allow for the new addition as well.

=================================================================
			<br/>
       Unzip this upgrade package into your main Renegade
			<br/>
       directory.  Run RGUPDATE.EXE to update miscellaneous
			<br/>
       data files and RENEGADE.DAT file.  Once this is done,
			<br/>
       the file can be erased.
			<br/>
			<br/>
       This is a "HotFix" to solve the XMS not loaded problem
			<br/>
  **   that a new windows update caused.  This should fix
			<br/>
       all issues with Renegade not loading.

Remember to add the following switches to your command
			<br/>
line to load Renegade properly.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Also, if using WinXP check your _DEFAULT.PIF file in
			<br/>
your main Windows directory.  Make sure all memory
			<br/>
settings are set to AUTO instead of NONE, or else RG
			<br/>
may or may not load.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Loading "RENEGADE -D" will load Renegade with Overlays
			<br/>
writing to DISK until you fix the memory issue with
			<br/>
the .PIF file in WinXP.  Do NOT run Renegade like this
			<br/>
all the time or the program will run very slow compared
			<br/>
to how it is supposed to run in memory.   This is just
			<br/>
a quick "fix" to be able to load the BBS and make sure
			<br/>
everything is working if you are getting a "Memory
			<br/>
Error."

			<br/>
We have included TEXT.ZIP as defaults that are needed.  Make sure
			<br/>
you append these to any "custom" strings you have so you will have
			<br/>
all strings to date. These should be the ONLY files in your TEXT
			<br/>
directory if you choose to create a seperate directory for these files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
Option 9. below should be changed in RGCFG.TXT to reflect the name
			<br/>
change from "RAM Drive/MulitNode Path" to "Strings/Text Directory".
			<br/>
You can keep the same path, but whatever the path is set in Option 9,
			<br/>
is where Renegade will look for ALL strings.

<h1 id="1.10"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v1.10/DOS ]----</h1></b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
1.  FIXED  -  Minor issue with log files.  Anytime a QWK was downloaded
			<br/>
              garbage was thrown to the log file.  This has been
			<br/>
              corrected and will now show correctly what was done.
			<br/>
			<br/>
2.  FIXED  -  Pressing "P" for Point entry in the file validation editor
			<br/>
              would go into a never ending loop if there were no
			<br/>
              un-validated files in a file area.
			<br/>
			<br/>
3.  FIXED  -  Pressing 
			<CR> in the file validation editor would exit
				<br/>
              the validation process rather then skip to the next file.
				<br/>
				<br/>
4.  CHANGE -  The file validation editor will now show the file areas
				<br/>
              being scanned just like other file search commands do.
				<br/>
				<br/>
5.  FIXED  -  The file area display header was off by one character.
				<br/>
				<br/>
6.  CHANGE -  In the past, the maximum number of file areas allowed
				<br/>
              was 2048 with compression turned on and 32767 with it
				<br/>
              turned off.  Renegade will now support 32767 file areas
				<br/>
              with compression on or off.
				<br/>
				<br/>
7.  CHANGE -  The file area listing will now display the file areas
				<br/>
              one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire list.
				<br/>
              The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from file
				<br/>
              area 1. Pressing 
				<CR> will now display the next page
					<br/>
              (it will also restart the listing from file area 1 when
					<br/>
              the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will exit
					<br/>
              the file area display. Previously, this procedure opened
					<br/>
              all 3 files associated to an area (*.DIR, *.EXT & *.SCN)
					<br/>
              to read file area scan flag. This process sould now be
					<br/>
              faster since it now only opens the *.SCN file.
					<br/>
					<br/>
8.  CHANGE -  The file area change listing will now display the file
					<br/>
              areas one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire
					<br/>
              list.  The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from
					<br/>
              file area 1. Pressing 
					<CR> will now display the next
						<br/>
              page (it will also restart the listing from file area 1
						<br/>
              when the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will
						<br/>
              exit the file area display. Entering an invalid file
						<br/>
              area will redisplay the current page.
						<br/>
						<br/>
9.  CHANGE -  The file area set scan listing will now display the file
						<br/>
              areas one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire
						<br/>
              list.  The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from
						<br/>
              file area 1. Pressing 
						<CR> will now display the next
							<br/>
              page (it will also restart the listing from file area 1
							<br/>
              when the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will
							<br/>
              exit the file area display. Previously, this procedure
							<br/>
              opened all 3 files associated to an area (*.DIR, *.EXT
							<br/>
              and *.SCN) to set the area scan on or off. This process
							<br/>
              should now be faster since it now only opens the *.SCN
							<br/>
              file.
							<br/>
							<br/>
              Also, this procedure will now only set the scan on file
							<br/>
              areas the user has access to. The file area scan char
							<br/>
              has been moved to the left of the file area number vice
							<br/>
              between it and the file area description.
							<br/>
							<br/>
9.  FIXED  -  The resolution of a GIF file was truncated by one
							<br/>
              character when viewing these files using the Achive
							<br/>
              View Command, fixed.  Also spruced up the entire
							<br/>
              display.  GIF files that are missing will now be
							<br/>
              displayed with a blinking red "< Missing GIF >".
							<br/>
              GIF files that are bad will now be displayed with a
							<br/>
              blinking red "< Bad GIF >".  Bad or missing GIF files
							<br/>
              are also now added to the SysOp Log. The first line
							<br/>
              of the file description has been reduced to 31 chars
							<br/>
              to allow for the maximum possible length of the GIF
							<br/>
              resolution.
							<br/>
							<br/>
  1.  The File Area Editor has made modified with the following:
							<br/>
							<br/>
      A. The file area listing will now display one page at a time
							<br/>
         verses scrolling to the prompt.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      B. The File Area Name can not be blank or the default of
							<br/><< New File Area >>.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      C. The File Area File Name can not be blank or the default of
							<br/>
         NEWAREA.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      D. The File Area Download Path can not be blank.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      E. The File Area Upload Path can not be blank.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      F. The File Area Archive Type must be active.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      G. The File Area Comment Type must be active.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      H. Unused fields in the Insert/Modify command will now
							<br/>
         display *None*.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      I. The File Area Insert command will now display the file
							<br/>
         Area information for editing verses just inserting the
							<br/>
         new record and then requiring you to go to the modify
							<br/>
         command to edit. You will not be able to save the
							<br/>
         new file area until all of the above items are correct.
							<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
							<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new file area.  The
							<br/>
         download/upload directories and the data files will be
							<br/>
         auto-created after the new file area is saved.  The *.SCN
							<br/>
         file will also be updated for all users to scan this file
							<br/>
         area.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      J. The File Area Delete command will no longer prompt to
							<br/>
         delete the data files if the the file area name is being
							<br/>
         utilized by another file area.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      K. The File Area Modify command will auto-create the
							<br/>
         download/upload path and data files after editing or
							<br/>
         changing to another file area.  The *.SCN file will
							<br/>
         also be updated to ensure all users are toggled to
							<br/>
         scan this file area.  You will not be able to save the
							<br/>
         file area you are editing until all of the above items
							<br/>
         are correct. This command has also been modified
							<br/>
         to scan the user file for deleted users and to set the
							<br/>
         *.SCN file to allow new scan for the next user to utilize
							<br/>
         this file area.
							<br/>
							<br/>
      L. Other changes included added some missing help data for
							<br/>
         certain commands and color changes.
							<br/>
							<br/>
  2.  I recommend that you access the File Area Modify command
							<br/>
      once you have installed this update and toggle thru all
							<br/>
      file areas and make corrections to your file areas as they
							<br/>
      are presented to you.

							<br/>
							<br/>
  1. The message area display header was off by one character, fixed.

										<br/>
         new message area until all of the above items are correct.
										<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
										<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new message area.  The
										<br/>
         message directory and the data files will be auto-created
										<br/>
         after the new message area is saved.  The *.SCN file will
										<br/>
         also be updated for all users to scan this file area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      I. The Message Area Delete command will no longer prompt to
										<br/>
         delete the data files if the message area file name is being
										<br/>
         utilized by another file area. This option has also been
										<br/>
         modified to prompt you to delete the message directory if it
										<br/>
         is not being utilized by another message area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      J. The Message Area Modify command will auto-create the
										<br/>
         message directory and data files after editing or
										<br/>
         changing to another file area.  The *.SCN file will
										<br/>
         also be updated to ensure all users are toggled to
										<br/>
         scan this message area.  You will not be able to save the
										<br/>
         message area you are editing until all of the above items
										<br/>
         are correct. This command has also been modified
										<br/>
         to scan the user file for deleted users and to set the
										<br/>
         *.SCN file to allow new scan for the next user to utilize
										<br/>
         this message area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      K. Other changes included added some missing help data for
										<br/>
         certain commands and color changes.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  4.  I recommend that you access the Message Area Modify command
										<br/>
      once you have installed this update and toggle thru all
										<br/>
      message areas and make corrections to your message areas as they
										<br/>
      are presented to you.
										<br/>
										<br/>
1.  The file/message area compression routines have been replaced
										<br/>
    completely. In the previous version the following variables,
										<br/>
    functions and procedures were utilized:
										<br/>
										<br/>
    VAR - "FileCompArray = ARRAY[0..4095] OF SET OF 0..7"
										<br/>
    VAR - "MsgCompArray = ARRAY[0..4095] OF SET OF 0..7"
										<br/>
    Procedure - "NewCompTables:
										<br/>
    Function - "CompFileArea(FArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "CompMsgArea(MArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "AFBase(FArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "AMBase(MArea: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
										<br/>
    The FileCompArray/MsgCompArray were previously updated by the
										<br/>
    NewCompTables Procedure.  The NewCompTables Procedure would
										<br/>
    simply read in all file/message areas and set a bit to on or off.
										<br/>
    The CompFileArea/CompMsgArea Functions would then display the proper
										<br/>
    File/Message area after counting from the first file/message area to
										<br/>
    the file/message area that needed to be displayed based on the user
										<br/>
    access and compression setting in System Configuration.  The
										<br/>
    AFBase/AMBase Functions were utilized to return the proper file/message
										<br/>
    area after counting from the first file/message area to the
										<br/>
    file/message area the user actually selected based on the user access
										<br/>
    and compression settings in System Confguration.
										<br/>
										<br/>
    As you can see from the above discription, this required alot of
										<br/>
    memory to maintain the FileCompArray/MsgCompArray.  It also required
										<br/>
    four functions for area number display and access. Not to mention
										<br/>
    that the real area number for both display and access had to be
										<br/>
    counted up to every time an area was displayed or accessed.
										<br/>
										<br/>
    The following varibales, functions and procedures are being
										<br/>
    utilized in this release:
										<br/>
										<br/>
    FILE - "FACT[Node].DAT" (Stored in the Node Temp Directory)
										<br/>
    FILE - "MACT[Node].DAT" (Stored in the Node Temp Directory)
										<br/>
    TYPE - "CompArrayType = ARRAY[0..1] OF INTEGER"
										<br/>
    VAR - "LowFileArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    VAR - "HighFileArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    VAR - "LowMsgArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    VAR - "HighMsgArea: Integer"
										<br/>
    Procedure - "NewCompTables"
										<br/>
    Function - "CompFileArea(FArea,ArrayNum: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
    Function - "CompMsgArea(MArea,ArrayNum: Integer): Integer"
										<br/>
										<br/>
    Two new files (FACT[Node].DAT/MACT[Node].DAT have been created and
										<br/>
    are temporarily stored in the Node temp directory.  A record of type
										<br/>
    ARRAY[0..1] OF Integer is the storage method utilized for the
										<br/>
    individual file areas.  ARRAY 0 is utilized for storage of the
										<br/>
    file/message area to display and ARRAY 1 is utilized for the storage
										<br/>
    of the file/message area being accessed. Each record takes up 2 bytes
										<br/>
    of space on your harddrive and the above file will only contain
										<br/>
    records for the actual number of message/file areas you actually have
										<br/>
    available. Both of these files are created at user logon and updated
										<br/>
    at other appropriate times as Renegade requires and then deleted when
										<br/>
    the user logs off.  The NewCompTables Procedure creates and updates
										<br/>
    the actual file/message area for display (ARRAY 0) and the actual
										<br/>
    file/message area to access (ARRAY 1).  This saves on the need to
										<br/>
    have the FileCompArray/MsgCompArray and the need for the
										<br/>
    CompFileArea/CompMsgArea And AFBase/AMBAse to count everytime
										<br/>
    from 1 to the file/message area displayed or accessed. The
										<br/>
    CompFileArea/CompMsgArea Functions have been modified to access the
										<br/>
    record contained in the FACT[Node].DAT/MACT[Node].DAT file for the
										<br/>
    file/message area being display/accessed.  This eliminated the need
										<br/>
    for the AFBase/AMBase Functions.  CompFileArea(FArea,0) or
										<br/>
    CompMsgArea(FArea,0) is called to obtained the display area number
										<br/>
    and CompFileArea(FArea,1) or CompMsgArea(FArea,1) is called for
										<br/>
    the area number to access.  NewCompTables will now also return the
										<br/>
    LowFileArea, HighFile, LowMsgArea & HighMsgArea for trapping correct
										<br/>
    or incorrect file/message area user input.
										<br/>
										<br/>
    As you can see, this enhancement saved alot of memory. Display and
										<br/>
    access to a file/message areas should now be faster.  Adding the
										<br/>
    low/high File/Messae variables will also help trap user input errors.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  The Conference Editor has made modified with the following:
										<br/>

										<br/>
         command to edit. You will not be able to save the
										<br/>
         new conference until the item above is correct.
										<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
										<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new conference area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      D. The Conference Modify command will also require that the
										<br/>
         above item is correct before saving the record being edited.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  2.  I recommend that you access the Conference Modify command

         command to edit. You will not be able to save the
										<br/>
         new validation record until all of the above items are correct.
										<br/>
         Upon completion of editing the inserted record, you will
										<br/>
         be prompted to save or discard the new validation record.

      C. The Protocol Editor Insert/Modify option will display only
										<br/>
         the fields required for the type of protocol you are
										<br/>
         setting up.  This is controlled by the Single/Batch Flags and
										<br/>
         the UL/DL Commands.  Numerous notes and error messages have

										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
<h1 id="1.00"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v1.00/DOS ]----</h1></b>
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
1.  ADDED  -  Two new commands for the message read menu: (See Updated
										<br/>
              MENUCMD.ASC File)
										<br/>
										<br/>
                RS = Show Message Poster (User Information)
										<br/>
                RV = Validate Message Poster (Level A-Z)
										<br/>
										<br/>
                MR CMD now needs an option to read public messages
										<br/>
                This was update last version but wasn't documented
										<br/>
                properly.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                MR = Read Messages [Options - R]
										<br/>
										<br/>
                  R - Read Public Message Areas
										<br/>
										<br/>
                Leaving the options field blank will read E-Mail.
										<br/>
										<br/>
2.  FIXED  -  When editing a message in the public areas, pressing E
										<br/>
              for edit and then pressing D to display header only
										<br/>
              displayed up to 5 lines.  If the message was posted as
										<br/>
              anonymous, you wouldn't see the 6th line for the real
										<br/>
              name to whatever name.
										<br/>
										<br/>
3.  CHANGE -  Intergrating email read menus to work in the existing
										<br/>
              public message read menus.  And then in so doing the
										<br/>
              "Back In Thread" and "Forward in Thread" now also work
										<br/>
              when reading private messages.  So, in the end, the
										<br/>
              private mail read menus will use the same public read
										<br/>
              menus, have the same look and feel.
										<br/>
										<br/>
4.  FIXED  -  Cleaned up the Validate user from the ReadMail command,
										<br/>
              this command allowed pressing a "Q" to quit, but in
										<br/>
              doing so, you would validate the user at whatever
										<br/>
              level "Q" was.  This was removed and require just that
										<br/>
              ENTER be pressed to avoid setting anything.
										<br/>
										<br/>
5.  CHANGE -  The move command to work to move messages from the
										<br/>
              public message areas to the private (not sure when the
										<br/>
              need might arise to do this, but maybe a flame in the
										<br/>
              public area and the sysop wants to move it to private
										<br/>
              if the receiver is a member of the bbs, rather then
										<br/>
              just delete it).
										<br/>
										<br/>
6.  CHANGE -  The messages are now listed before selecting a message.
										<br/>
              Before, all you got was a prompt that said what area
										<br/>
              you were in and the range of the messages to select from.
										<br/>
              Now, when reading all private mail or public mail, The
										<br/>
              messages are listed (With header) up to 18 messages per
										<br/>
              page.  Pressing enter takes you to the next page or 
										<br/>
              listing of messages.  Once you reached the end of the
										<br/>
              messages (by pressing ENTER) and you press it again, it
										<br/>
              will take you back to the first message and you can
										<br/>
              continue to list messages that way until you select
										<br/>
              one or quit.
										<br/>
										<br/>
7.  FIXED  -  The creation of VDM*.TMP files in Windows XP caused by
										<br/>
              Renegade are now fixed.  These files should NO LONGER
										<br/>
              be created because of file locking issues with Renegade.
										<br/>
              It took a while to fix, but ... it's windows, yaknow. ;)
										<br/>
										<br/>
8.  ADDED  -  Added a new MENUCMD Key : 
										<br/>
										<br/>
              RJ  -  Forward Public Message into Private Mail and
										<br/>
                     also Private E-Mail to another Private E-Mail
										<br/>
                     account.
										<br/>
										<br/>
              This CMD Key is for the READP Menu ONLY to FORWARD a
										<br/>
              public message to private e-mail.
										<br/>
										<br/>
9.  CHANGE  - The High Read Msg Pointers are no longer updated after
										<br/>
              a new account is created.  This was taking a very long
										<br/>
              time if a BBS had a large amount of messgae areas. This
										<br/>
              is now done the first time the user scans the msg areas.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
10.  FIXED  - A bug where if the sysop shells inside a background input
										<br/>
              prompt (Blue for example) the screen will no longer turn
										<br/>
              the color of the input box in the shell.  It will clear
										<br/>
              the screen using a black background, lightgrey foreground.
										<br/>
										<br/>
11.  FIXED  - RG would attempt to create the entire directory (Example:
										<br/>
              C:\rg\dls\test).  If dls didn't exist before the "test",
										<br/>
              it would fail.  Now, it will create the entire directory
										<br/>
              (if the path is valid).  It now also reports errors to the 
										<br/>
              user on screen.
										<br/>
										<br/>
12.  CHANGE - You can now use a "D" to make the ULPath the same as the
										<br/>
              DLPath instead of typing in the entire path if they are
										<br/>
              the same when creating a new file area.
										<br/>
										<br/>
13.  CHANGE - New History Editor - You can now edit dates and information
										<br/>
              inside the HISTORY.DAT file to correct any errors that
										<br/>
              are noticed.   You can now view logons by BAUD RATE via the
										<br/>
              history editor.
										<br/>
										<br/>
14.  FIXED  - Numerous updates to all the door drop files (ongoing).
										<br/>
										<br/>
15.  CHANGE - Updated "RENEGADE.LNG" file, and new converter "RGLNG.EXE"
										<br/>
              which compiles the few remaining strings and removes all
										<br/>
              strings that were moved to differnt files and locations
										<br/>
              on previous versions.
										<br/>
										<br/>
16.  CHANGE - FILE_ID.DIZ File Descriptions are now expanded to 99 lines.
										<br/>
              All you ASCII Art Freaks should scream "Hor-ray!"
										<br/>
										<br/>
17.  FIXED  - Time Slice Routines - RG now actually detects if it is
										<br/>
              running under DOS, OS2 or Win32 and act accordingly.  Before
										<br/>
              Renegade ALWAYS thought it was under DOS and thus caused
										<br/>
              some slow down which was sort of addressed with the time
										<br/>
              slice setting in system config.  This will help even more
										<br/>
              now that it is hardcoded to look for this.
										<br/>
										<br/>
18. OLD/NEW - MENUCMD  *=  This allows Renegade to display long or short
										<br/>
              menu cmd listings.  *= with options set at 1 will display
										<br/>
              short menu cmds.  *= with options set at 2 will display
										<br/>
              long menu cmds to the screen.
										<br/>
										<br/>
19.  FIXED  - "FC" CMD KEY (Files.BBS Importer)
										<br/>
										<br/>
               1.  Optimized by removing a duplicate procedure.
										<br/>
               2.  Reports duplicate files in the Sysop.log.
										<br/>
               3.  Reports missing files in the Sysop.log.
										<br/>
               4.  The "Hatched" flag is now set for all imported files.
										<br/>
               5.  The user can now enter file points per file uploaded
										<br/>
                   when not in the waiting for caller screen (Parameter
										<br/>
                   switch -F).
										<br/>
               6.  All User/System upload statistics are checked for
										<br/>
                   variable overrun.
										<br/>
               7.  FILE_ID.DIZ will only be checked if allowed by
										<br/>
                   System Config setting.
										<br/>
										<br/>
20.  FIXED  - "*1" CMD KEY (Edit Files)
										<br/>
										<br/>
               1.  File name change will no longer allow renaming a
										<br/>
                   file if the new file names exists in the upload or
										<br/>
                   download path.
										<br/>
               2.  The Filesize limit as been increased to allow for
										<br/>
                   a maximum of 1.9 Gigs.  You now also have the choice
										<br/>
                   of updating with the actual file size or entering
										<br/>
                   whatever you like up to the 1.9 Gig limit.
										<br/>
               3.  You may now interactively edit the file description.
										<br/>
               4.  Changing the user name or number now reports an error
										<br/>
                   if the user does not exist.
										<br/>
               5.  Changing the upload date of the file will not allow
										<br/>
                   entry of a date beyond the current date.
										<br/>
               6.  The number of downloads has been increased to allow
										<br/>
                   up to 2147483647.
										<br/>
               7.  The modify extended description option has been
										<br/>
                   revamped.  If one exists, you will first be asked if
										<br/>
                   you would like to delete it, if one doesn't, you will
										<br/>
                   be asked if you would like to create one.  If you
										<br/>
                   decide to keep the exisiting one or created one,
										<br/>
                   you will be taken to the standard full screen message
										<br/>
                   editor, the old line by line edit mode has been
										<br/>
                   removed.  Existing extended descriptions will be
										<br/>
                   copied into the message editor for editing.  All
										<br/>
                   message editing option are available for line edit
										<br/>
                   or full screen edit mode.
										<br/>
               8.  The file move cmd has been revamped provides clearer
										<br/>
                   error message.
										<br/>
               9.  The User Editor option will now display messages if
										<br/>
                   the user doesn't meet the access requirement and
										<br/>
                   also default to User #1 if the current owner of the
										<br/>
                   file has been deleted.
										<br/>
              10.  All User/System upload statistics are checked for
										<br/>
                   variable overrun.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                                        - NOTE -
										<br/>
										<br/>
               A.  While editing the file owner name, the owner name
										<br/>
                   will be checked against the user name stored in
										<br/>
                   the user editor.  If the names do not match, the
										<br/>
                   file owner name will be converted to the Sysop name
										<br/>
                   (User #1).  The editor will assume that the orignal
										<br/>
                   uploader account has been deleted.
										<br/>
										<br/>
               B.  While updating the file size, if the file does not
										<br/>
                   exist, you will be asked if you would like to set
										<br/>
                   the file to offline or request status.
										<br/>
										<br/>
               C.  Use File_ID.DIZ must now be turn on in System
										<br/>
                   Config to be able to update or upload the Extended
										<br/>
                   Description (if it exists).
										<br/>
										<br/>
               D.  The internal archive viewer will now only attempt
										<br/>
                   to display files with the following extentions
										<br/>
                   (ZIP,ARC,PAK,ZOO,LZH,ARK,ARJ). IF the extention is
										<br/>
                   valid and the file doesn't exist, you will be
										<br/>
                   prompted to set the file to offline or to request
										<br/>
                   status.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
21.  CHANGE - FILE_ID.DIZ File Descriptions are now extended to 99 lines
										<br/>
              of text per file.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                NOTE:
										<br/>
										<br/>
                  The way extended description were handled has
										<br/>
                  been revamped.  Prior to this release, every
										<br/>
                  extended description required 950 bytes of
										<br/>
                  hard drive space rather the description required
										<br/>
                  it or not and was limited to 19 lines.  This
										<br/>
                  version now allows up to 99 lines of 50 chars
										<br/>
                  each and will only require space for the actual
										<br/>
                  characters utilized plus one byte for every line
										<br/>
                  in the description. For example: "This is a great
										<br/>
                  file" would only require 20 + 1 byte or 21 bytes
										<br/>
                  of harddrive space verses the old minimum of
										<br/>
                  950 bytes.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
22.  ADDED  - "OB" CMD KEY (User Statistics)
										<br/>
										<br/>
                1.  Renegade now has built in User Top 10 Statistics.
										<br/>
                    I recommend that a new menu be created for these
										<br/>
                    cmds.  Menu options are listed below along with
										<br/>
                    the title of the action performed.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                2.  Adding ;## will not allow that specific user to
										<br/>
                    be included in the stats file.  Example:  A;1
										<br/>
                    would not all User #1 to be posted in the current
										<br/>
                    stats screen.
										<br/>
										<br/>
                          Option     Top 10 Result
										<br/>
										<br/>
                             A         High Time Users
										<br/>
                             B         File Kbyte Uploaders
										<br/>
                             C         File Kbyte Downloaders
										<br/>
                             D         Private Message Senders
										<br/>
                             E         Public Message Posters
										<br/>
                             F         SysOp Feedback Senders
										<br/>
                             G         All Time Callers
										<br/>
                             H         File Uploaders
										<br/>
                             I         File Downloaders
										<br/>
                             J         File Points
										<br/>
                             K         Upload/Download Ratios
										<br/>
                             L         Post/Call Ratios
										<br/>
                             M         Top Download Files
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
23.  ADDED  - "L7" CMD KEY (File Archive View Tagging)
										<br/>
										<br/>
              Used on FILEP menu to allow file tagging when
										<br/>
              viewing internal archives.  Sames some time from
										<br/>
              having to type out the full filename. ;)
										<br/>
										<br/>
24.  CHANGE - Added 2 60 character lines to voting editor.  This
										<br/>
              replaces the 1 line of 65 characters.  Now you have
										<br/>
              2 lines to ramble on about for your voting pleasure.
										<br/>
										<br/>
25.  CHANGE - Moved time bank options from the timebank menu to
										<br/>
              System Config, Option E, Cmds X, Y, and Z.  This
										<br/>
              involved Max Time, Max Withdrawl, Max Deposit.
										<br/>
										<br/>
              No longer do you have to list these options in the
										<br/>
              options field of each command as they are now hard
										<br/>
              coded into Renegade.
										<br/>
										<br/>
26.  FIXED  - The Color Codes of the SYSOP.LOG file, no longer
										<br/>
              bleed from line to line.  Now each line will have
										<br/>
              it's own apporiate color(s), if color for logfile
										<br/>
              is turned on in System Config.
										<br/>
										<br/>
27.  ADDED  - Option to Messagae Base Editor to Renumber the
										<br/>
              QWK Index.  This is inplace to ensure each base
										<br/>
              has it's own IDX # and there are no duplicates.
										<br/>
              This should really only be used if you are
										<br/>
              having issues with QWK, or if you don't do a
										<br/>
              lot of QWK, to renumber the QWK # to match the
										<br/>
              base position number in the editor.
										<br/>
										<br/>
28.  ADDED  - ALT-S while a user is online will now enter into a
										<br/>
              split screen chat mode session.  ALT-C still works
										<br/>
              the same as before in a line by line text mode
										<br/>
              chat session.
										<br/>
										<br/>
              ALT-S was previously (Turn SysOp Status Bar ON/OFF),
										<br/>
              this cmd has moved to ALT-A.
										<br/>
										<br/>
29.  CHANGE - Made RGLNG to compile all strings in one easy swoop.
										<br/>
              RENEGADE.LNG needs renamed to RGLNG.TXT for this to
										<br/>
              work tho.
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
										<br/>
 ---------------------- READ BELOW FOR CHANGES!!! -------------------------
										<br/>
										<br/>
Validation System Changes:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  In order to save memory, the validation records were moved from
										<br/>
      the RENEGADE.DAT file to the new VALIDATE.DAT file. These records
										<br/>
      were previously stored as an array of 1 to 26 records taking up
										<br/>
      about 3484 bytes of memory when loaded. This array also limited
										<br/>
      the number of available validation records to a maximum of 26.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  2.  Removing the validation records from the array stored in memory
										<br/>
      also allowed for increasing the maximum allowed validation records
										<br/>
      from 26 to 94. Of course, this changed the range of validation keys
										<br/>
      from A-Z to !-~.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  3.  Since the old new user validation key was logically the letter "A"
										<br/>
      (Or first character in the set).  The '!' is now the first character
										<br/>
      in the set and became the new user validation key.  The code has been
										<br/>
      internally modified to accept this key as such.  So, if you are using
										<br/>
      the letter "A" in your scripts or for your auto-validation command,
										<br/>
      please change it to the "!".
										<br/>
										<br/>
  4.  The VALIDATE.DAT file is checked during boot-up for existance and
										<br/>
      to ensure that it contains at least the new user validation record.
										<br/>
      Available validation keys are also stored in memory for later use
										<br/>
      in the validation process.
										<br/>
										<br/>
Validation Editor:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  The Validation Editor has been completely re-written adding a record
										<br/>
      delete, insert and position function. The modify option has also been
										<br/>
      extensively modified.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  2.  The deletion function will not allow removal of the new user
										<br/>
      validation record. It will also not allow you to remove a validation
										<br/>
      key that is still attached as an expire to key for any users.  You
										<br/>
      must first delete the expire to key from all users prior to deleting
										<br/>
      the effected key from the validation editor. Deleting a key also
										<br/>
      removes it from memory and global use.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  3.  The insert function will allow adding any one of the possible 94
										<br/>
      validation keys if it does not already exist. Inserting a key adds
										<br/>
      it to memory and is also available for global use.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  4.  Changes to the modify option:
										<br/>
										<br/>
      A.  Added a header to the records list display.
										<br/>
      B.  Added the Validation key to the record.  This key can not be
										<br/>
          modified.
										<br/>
      C.  The validation key description can not be modified for the
										<br/>
          new user validation key.
										<br/>
      D.  Added a free form field that will be sent to the user as a
										<br/>
          short message at logon.  This field should be utilized to inform
										<br/>
          the user of the type of validation they received.
										<br/>
      E.  The SL can no longer be lower then the SL stored in the New User
										<br/>
          Record of the USERS.DAT file (Record 0).
										<br/>
      F.  The DSL can no longer be lower then the DSL stored in the New
										<br/>
          User Record of the USERS.DAT file (Record 0).
										<br/>
      G.  Combined the AR modification and AR upgrade option into one cmd.
										<br/>
      H.  Combined the AC modification and AC upgrade option into one cmd.
										<br/>
      I.  Added a field for file point entry (Not implimented).
										<br/>
      J.  Increased the allowable credits from 65535 to 2147483647.
										<br/>
      K.  Added menu display for the start menu option.
										<br/>
      L.  Combined the expiration days/expire to option in one command.
										<br/>
          Before, you could actually set one and not other.  Expiration
										<br/>
          days without an expire to key wouldn't do anything more then
										<br/>
          having an expire to key without expiration days. Setting a null
										<br/>
          value for one forces they other to a null value as well. You can
										<br/>
          not modify these fields for the new user validation record.  Why
										<br/>
          would you want to expire someone below your lowest value. Also,
										<br/>
          you will only be able to attach keys that actually exists. This
										<br/>
          Expire To key can not be the same as the validation key
										<br/>
          associated to the record you are currently modifying.
										<br/>
										<br/>
  5.  The position command works the same as it would in any other editor
										<br/>
      within renegade.
										<br/>
										<br/>
User Editor:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  Combined the expiration days/expire to option in one command.
										<br/>
      Before, you could actually set one and not other.  Expiration
										<br/>
      days without an expire to key wouldn't do anything more then
										<br/>
      having an expire to key without expiration days. Setting a null
										<br/>
      value for one forces they other to a null value as well. Also,
										<br/>
      you will only be able to attach keys that actually exists.
										<br/>
										<br/>
      NOTE: You must set both the expiration date and expire to key to
										<br/>
            null for every user it's attached to should you ever want to
										<br/>
            delete a validation key.
										<br/>
										<br/>
Auto-Validation Command:
										<br/>
										<br/>
  1.  The menu option is checked for proper syntex 
										<password;Level>.
											<br/>
  2.  The level is checked to ensure it actually exists or logs an error.
											<br/>
  3.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
											<br/>
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
											<br/>
  4.  This command will exit and log an error if the "Expire To Level"
											<br/>
      does not exists.
											<br/>
  5.  This command will exit and log an error if a user attempts to
											<br/>
      validate themselves at the same access level (Checks SL/DSL/AR/AC).
											<br/>
  6.  This command will exit and log an error if a user attempts to
											<br/>
      validate themselves at a lower access level (Checks SL/DSL).
											<br/>
  7.  The password length is now set to a maximum of 20 characters.
											<br/>
  8.  Entry of the password is now masked.
											<br/>
  9.  Incorrect password entry exits and logs and error.
											<br/>
  10. If it exists, the file "AUTOVAL" is displayed upon sucessfull
											<br/>
      validation. Otherwise, the user message stored in the validation
											<br/>
      level is displayed.
											<br/>
  11. The sysop window message and sysop log entry has been changed to
											<br/>
      display either "himself" or "herself" (Depending on the user gender)
											<br/>
      and the auto-validation level.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Validation (Prompted):
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  The validation level selection prompt will only except entry of an
											<br/>
      existing level in the validation editor.
											<br/>
  2.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
											<br/>
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
											<br/>
  3.  This command will display a message if the "Expire To Level" does
											<br/>
      not exists.
											<br/>
  4.  This command will display a message to the user if an attempt is made
											<br/>
      to validate a user at the same access level (Checks SL/DSL/AR/AC).
											<br/>
  5.  This command will now display both the old a new settings when a
											<br/>
      validation key is selected and offer the user an option to continue
											<br/>
      with validation using the current level or select another level.
											<br/>
  6.  The user is now sent the short message stored in the validation level.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Validation (Internel):
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  The level is checked to ensure it actually exists or exits and logs
											<br/>
      an error.
											<br/>
  2.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
											<br/>
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
											<br/>
  3.  The "Expire To" level is checked to ensure it actually exists or the
											<br/>
      option exits and logs an error.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											<br/>
Conference System Changes:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  In order to save memory, the conference records were converted
											<br/>
      from loading as an array of records to load as a single record.
											<br/>
      These records were previously stored as an array of 1 to 27
											<br/>
      records taking up about 1674 bytes of memory when loaded.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  2.  The CONFRENC.DAT file is checked during boot-up for existance and
											<br/>
      to ensure that it contains at least the general conference record.
											<br/>
      Available conference keys are also stored in memory for later use
											<br/>
      in the conference system process.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Conference Editor:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  The Conference Editor has been completely re-written adding a record
											<br/>
      position function.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  2.  The deletion function will not allow removal of the general
											<br/>
      conference record. Deleting a conference will also convert the
											<br/>
      last conference a user was in to the general conference if it was
											<br/>
      the same conference being deleted. Deleting a key also removes it
											<br/>
      from memory and global use.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  3.  The insert function will allow adding any one of the possible 27
											<br/>
      conference records if it does not already exist. Inserting a key
											<br/>
      adds it to memory and is also available for global use.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  4.  Changes to the modify option:
											<br/>
											<br/>
      A.  Added the conference key to the record.  This key can not be
											<br/>
          modified.
											<br/>
      C.  The conference description can not be modified for the
											<br/>
          general conference.
											<br/>
											<br/>
  5.  The position command works the same as it would in any other editor
											<br/>
      within renegade.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Change Conference Command:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  Will now generate an error if the menu option is not an existing
											<br/>
      conference or '?'.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											<br/>
The following features have been added to RG:
											<br/>
											<br/>
  1.  Added an option to toggle all AR flags "*".
											<br/>
  2.  Added a clear fields function. This feature can be accessed by pressing 
											<br/>
"$" in the user editor.  Any fields that are cleared will be re-asked of the 
											<br/>
user the next time they logon.  Handy for questionable entries in the user 
											<br/>
record.
											<br/>
											<br/>
Internal Message Editor Changes:
											<br/>
											<br/>
   1.  The total line counter was off by one, fixed.
											<br/>
											<br/>
   2.  The line editor was originally split into two separate sub menus.
											<br/>
       The first menu allowed for general adding of text and editing
											<br/>
       along with the importing of text files, attaching files, etc.
											<br/>
       If you wanted to edit a line, you had to exit to the second menu.
											<br/>
       This second menu also contained some commands that were duplicative
											<br/>
       from of first menu.  Now, these two menus have been combined
											<br/>
       into one menu.  All duplicative code has been removed.
											<br/>
											<br/>
   3.  A number of new user error messages have been added utilizing the
											<br/>
       color code  or Red.
											<br/>
											<br/>
   4.  Command changes:
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Abort -  Will now display an error message if the message can not
											<br/>
                be aborted.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Clear -  Will now display an error message if the message is empty.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Delete - Will now display an error message if the message is empty.
											<br/>
                This command will also display the deleted line and give
											<br/>
                you an option to continue or not with it's deletion.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       File Attach - Will now display an error message if the user does
											<br/>
                     not have file attach access.  The user is also
											<br/>
                     prompted as to rather they wish to proceed with
											<br/>
                     the file attachment or not.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Insert - Will now display an error message if the message is empty
											<br/>
                and when the user has reached the maximum lines allowed.
											<br/>
                The user will be prompted with the line number to insert
											<br/>
                and asked if they want to proceed with the line insertion.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       List   - Will now display an error message if the message is
											<br/>
                empty.  Will now ask the user if they want to list the
											<br/>
                entire message or allow the user to enter a starting
											<br/>
                line number. The listing "Pause" has been changed to
											<br/>
                the "Allow Continue" pause.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Dsiable MCI - Will now display an error message if the user does
											<br/>
                     not meet the access requirements.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Replace String - Will now display an error message if the message
											<br/>
                        is empty.  The user is prompted to continue or
											<br/>
                        not with the string replacemnt after editing.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Quote - Will display an error message if the user is not
											<br/>
               replying to a message.  Will also display an error
											<br/>
               message when the maximum lines are reached. Corrected
											<br/>
               the line number display (it would only justify up to
											<br/>
               2 char positions, will now adjust for 3).
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Delete Last Line - Will now display an error message if the
											<br/>
                          message is empty.  Will prompt the user to
											<br/>
                          continue or not with the last line deletion.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Save -  Will now delete any empty lines at the end of the message.
											<br/>
               Ever notice an empty saved message.  This was due to the
											<br/>
               fact that a user could just hit the space bar to save one
											<br/>
               line of the message.  Now, this line is checked for all
											<br/>
               spaces and not saved.  An error message is sent to a user
											<br/>
               that can not abort the message if the message contains no
											<br/>
               text.  A message can not be saved that contains no text
											<br/>
               (Or at least I hope I thought of everything).
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Title - An error message is sent to the user if they can not change
											<br/>
               the title.  This normally applies to non-abortable
											<br/>
               messages.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Upload - An error message is sent to the user if they have reached
											<br/>
                the maximum line limit.
											<br/>
											<br/>
       Replace Line - An error message is sent to the user if the message
											<br/>
                      is empty.  The user is prompted to continue with
											<br/>
                      the line replacement or not.
											<br/>
											<br/>
											<CR> -  Will allow you to continue adding lines to the message or
												<br/>
               will display the PRHELP.ASC file after every 5 keypresses
												<br/>
               when the maximum lines have been reached.
												<br/>
												<br/>
       ? - Displays the new PRHELP.ASC file.
												<br/>
												<br/>
   5.  If the maximum lines have not be reached, pressing the enter key
												<br/>
       five times will display the following messages:
												<br/>
												<br/>
       "Enter "/?" on a blank line for help."
												<br/>
												<br/>
       The 5 proceeding blank lines will also be removed.  This is helpful
												<br/>
       for new users.
												<br/>
												<br/>
   6.  Discovered a maximum character per line difference between the
												<br/>
       Full Screen Editor and the Line Editor.  This error was actually
												<br/>
       with the char count in the Line Editor and has been corrected.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Additional Message Editor Changes:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Non-abortable message changes (New User, etc):
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A. File attachment not allowed - Attaching a file
												<br/>
         would change the original subject of the message.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      B. Title change not allowed - The original receiver and
												<br/>
         subject should remain the same.
												<br/>
												<br/>
         Note:  The user can not abort or save a message that
												<br/>
                contains no text.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  File attachment changes:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  In previous releases, a user with file attachment access
												<br/>
          was not warned if they tried to attach a file when a file
												<br/>
          was already attached. However, this basically allowed the
												<br/>
          user to swap out the file should they attach an incorrect
												<br/>
          file.  In this release, if a file is already attached, the
												<br/>
          attached file will be displayed and the user will be prompted
												<br/>
          to replace the file.  I took this a step further, a user may
												<br/>
          also want to remove the attached file all together.  Presently,
												<br/>
          there is no option for this without aborting the message.
												<br/>
          Therefore, an option has been added for removing the attached
												<br/>
          file.  In this case, the user is also prompted to change the
												<br/>
          message subject.  If the subject contains no text, removing
												<br/>
          the attached file is aborted.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  Error messages:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  I did not feel there was adequate messages to the user as to
												<br/>
          certain editor options.  So, this area has been greatly
												<br/>
          expanded.  For example: Pressing "C" to clear a message
												<br/>
          when the message contains no text, now informs the user of
												<br/>
          this situation rather then nothing at all.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  Empty messages:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  In an effort to reduce the possibilty of an empty message being
												<br/>
          saved, the following apply:
												<br/>
												<br/>
          1.  All null lines at the end of a message are deleted.
												<br/>
          2.  All lines at the end of a message containing nothing
												<br/>
              but spaces are deleted.
												<br/>
												<br/>
          NOTE:  Lines are reviewed in reverse order up to the first
												<br/>
                 line containing text. The user will not be able to
												<br/>
                 save the message unless it contains some kind of
												<br/>
                 text.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  Title change:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      A.  In certain cases, changing the title would actually remove
												<br/>
          the subject of the message.  I believe this error has now
												<br/>
          been corrected.
												<br/>
												<br/>
1.  File Downloads -
												<br/>
												<br/>
    A.  If an actual protocol (Like ZModem) was the first protocol
												<br/>
        (or record zero), the downloaded file would not have the UL/DL
												<br/>
        ratio checked.  This was do to the ratio being set to look for
												<br/>
        protocol records from [1..200].  Also, the maximum protocols
												<br/>
        allowed at present is 120.  The above should have been [0..120]
												<br/>
        to be correct.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    B.  For the ratio check, the FindFirst procedure would look for the
												<br/>
        file on the harddrive even if the ratio didn't need to be checked.
												<br/>
        This procedure was moved to only get the filesize if the ratio
												<br/>
        needs to be checked.  
												<br/>
												<br/>
        NOTE:  The FindFirst procedure would allow searching of any type
												<br/>
        of file on the hardrive.  This has been changed to not allow
												<br/>
        searching of Directory, VolumnID, Hidden & SysFiles.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    C.  In the present version, duplicate files could be added to the
												<br/>
        batch download queue.  This alpha release no longer allows
												<br/>
        duplicate files in the queue.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    D.  Downloading any file locally would place an entry in
												<br/>
        the sysop.log that the DL was successfull, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    E.  Adding a file to the batch DL queue will no loner indicate in the
												<br/>
        sysop.log that the file was downloaded successfully.  Now, it
												<br/>
        will either indicate that the file was added to the batch queue or
												<br/>
        that an unlisted file was added to the batch queue.  Adding a file
												<br/>
        to the queue doesn't complete the DL.
												<br/>
												<br/>
    F.  The ASCII download of a file has been modified.  The allow
												<br/>
        continue prompt and a pause after the DL has been added.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
File download buf fixes/enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  The Star procedure would carry the last color to the next
												<br/>
      line, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  Downloading a file locally would increment various dl statistics,
												<br/>
      fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  Downloading an unlisted file locally will now prompt the sysop
												<br/>
      or user for a path to copy the file to (Like a regular download
												<br/>
      currently does).
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  The copy command for local downloads, local unlisted downloads
												<br/>
      and copy from CDRom now gives more detail as to the status of
												<br/>
      the copy both to the user and sysop.log.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  Viewing a text file will now indicate that it was viewed vice
												<br/>
      downloaded both to the user and sysop.log.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6.  Attemtping to view a text file that is missing will no longer
												<br/>
      increment the DL statistics.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7.  The system should no longer allow downloading or uploading of
												<br/>
      batch files locally.  It should also no longer increment DL/UL
												<br/>
      statistics for batch transfers.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  8.  The user record was saved everytime a file was selected for
												<br/>
      download even if the download was aborted or not completed,
												<br/>
      fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  9.  There was an error in the checking of DL codes against the
												<br/>
      returncode when downloading files.  The DL codes in the
												<br/>
      protocol record are currently strings.  This string was being
												<br/>
      converted to a numeric value internally even if it were empty.
												<br/>
      The string to numeric conversion routine would interpret this
												<br/>
      empty string as a value of zero.  Since the value for success
												<br/>
      was set to a zero also, the system would assume a successful
												<br/>
      result.  Now, if the DLCode is a null string, it is not compared
												<br/>
      against the return code.  You may now have to input a zero into
												<br/>
      one of the DLCodes in the protocol record for a proper comparison.
												<br/>
      This also applies to the ULCodes in the protocol record.
												<br/>
												<br/>
 10.  Removed an extra file area initialization procedure in the DLX
												<br/>
      procedure.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade enhancements/bug fix's:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Removed a duplicate procedure for crediting the uploader for a
												<br/>
      file that was downloaded by another user.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  During a batch download, if no DL/Temp log was specified in the
												<br/>
      protocol editor, the uploader did not receive credit for the
												<br/>
      download. Other system/user statistics were updated though,
												<br/>
      fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  The above credit procedure never worked anyway due to some
												<br/>
      calculation errors in the code, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  A message telling the user to enjoy the file was only displayed
												<br/>
      if the user was charged file points, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  Messages to the user and the sysop.log provide additonal
												<br/>
      information about the Single Download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade BBS Enhancements/Bug Fix's:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Before the posting of a message or uploading of a file
												<br/>
      (Batch/Single), the available drive space was checked to
												<br/>
      ensure adequate space exists according to the system setup.
												<br/>
      This section of the code was duplicated in 3 places.  I converted
												<br/>
      this section to a function reducing numerous lines of code and
												<br/>
      extra variabes whenever it was utilized in the code.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  The copy/move procedures are now combined into one function.
												<br/>
      Variables for failure, no space and success were required
												<br/>
      external to the procedures everytime they were called. Various
												<br/>
      messages to the user/sysop.log were also reported external
												<br/>
      to these procedures.  I also noticed that the move procedure
												<br/>
      called the copy procedure if renaming a file was not successfull.
												<br/>
      Now, no variables are required externally for the function and
												<br/>
      messages to the user/sysop.log are handled internally within
												<br/>
      the copy/move function.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  I noticed that a section of the code for executing file
												<br/>
      transfer's was duplicated in 4 places.  This has been moved to
												<br/>
      a single procedure reducing numerous lines of code and
												<br/>
      variables.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  I noticed that a section of the code for checking the return
												<br/>
      code on file transfer's was duplicated in 3 places.  This has
												<br/>
      been moved to a single procedure reducing numerous lines of code
												<br/>
      and variables.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  The FILES.BBS selected for download during a batch transfer by
												<br/>
      the user now contains this starting entry:
												<br/>
												<br/>
       "(BBS Name) Batch Download File Listing"
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Previously, unlisted files were not written to the above list.
												<br/>
      Now, they are with "[No Description Available]" as the description.
												<br/>
      Also, files in the batch download queue with a bad path download
												<br/>
      path will have "[Bad Download Path]" as the description. These
												<br/>
      additions help account for files selected for Batch DL by the
												<br/>
      user.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6.  The max dos character field in the protocol editor has now been
												<br/>
      limited to 127 characters (Was 255).  I always thought it was 128,
												<br/>
      however I couldn't type in any more then 127 characters on the
												<br/>
      command line in DOS. Please feel free to check this out for
												<br/>
      yoursele and change you editor accordingly.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7.  Removed spaces from the file name written to the protocol file
												<br/>
      list for batch downloads.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  8.  The procedure that reads the success/failure codes and file name
												<br/>
      from the protocol temp log has been modified.  The starting
												<br/>
      position of the code and file name is specified in the protocol
												<br/>
      editor.  Assumming you set this up correctly, the success/failure
												<br/>
      code and the filename are copied to temporary strings. The success
												<br/>
      code is compared against the returncode from dos for single
												<br/>
      download/upload protocols or the DLCode specified in the protocol
												<br/>
      editor for batch downloads and the temp log.  This code is not
												<br/>
      utilized for batch uploads, the file is simply checked for existance.
												<br/>
      The temporary file name is compared against the batch queue for
												<br/>
      existance.  Since different protocol programs like dsz, etc utilize
												<br/>
      different log formats, it's impossible to tell the actual length of
												<br/>
      the success code or filename read from the temp log.  RG would simply
												<br/>
      read each string from the starting position and then chop off any
												<br/>
      trailing spaces and compared them as per above.  However, with ZM
												<br/>
      protocol, the file name ends with ",".  Therefore, I changed the
												<br/>
      comparison to look for the success code/filename to a String POS
												<br/>
      procedure rather then String = String.  In local tests (Both Single
												<br/>
      and Batch) it seemed to work without issue, we will see? The way it
												<br/>
      was handled before did not work with ZM protocol.  Hopefully, this
												<br/>
      solves it for all others (assuming you set things up correctly in the
												<br/>
      protocol editor.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Here's a few things I learned about protocols while editing the
												<br/>
      RG code:
												<br/>
												<br/>
        1.  If you set the option "Codes mean" in the protocol editor
												<br/>
            to "Transfer Successfull", you must specify a return dlcode
												<br/>
            and or ulcode for single protocols of zero.  Zero is hard
												<br/>
            coded into the procedure that executes the protocol.  A
												<br/>
            return code of zero from DOS indicates a successfull result.
												<br/>
            Of course, you could also reverse the above and specify
												<br/>
            "Codes mean" as "Transfer Failed" and specify all possible
												<br/>
            DLCodes/ULCodes as something other then zero.
												<br/>
												<br/>
        2.  If you do not specify a temp log for batch downloads, no
												<br/>
            error checking occurs within RG.  RG assumes the files were
												<br/>
            downloaded and increments statistics, etc.  RG does not create
												<br/>
            the temp log, you must add it to the DL/UL command line. You
												<br/>
            must also specify the proper file name and status starting
												<br/>
            positions within the log for RG to locate them.  Please
												<br/>
            read the protocol document for a description of the log
												<br/>
            entries and then count out the status & filename positions
												<br/>
            for the protocol editor.
												<br/>
												<br/>
            Here's what you need for the ZM protocol:
												<br/>
												<br/>
              1. Specify a Temp Log.
												<br/>
              2. Add -lz%L to the DL/UL Command Line to create a ZM
												<br/>
                 style log.
												<br/>
              3. Set "Codes mean" to "Transfer Successfull".
												<br/>
              4. Set DL/UL Code 1 as Z, Set DL/UL Code 2 as z.
												<br/>
              5. Set "File name" to 22.
												<br/>
              6. Set "Status" to 1.
												<br/>
												<br/>
              OR
												<br/>
												<br/>
              1. Specify a Temp Log.
												<br/>
              2. Add -ld%L to the DL/UL Command Line to create a DSZ
												<br/>
                 style log.
												<br/>
              3. Set "Codes mean" to "Transfer Successfull".
												<br/>
              4. Set DL/UL Code 1 as Z, Set DL/UL Code 2 as z.
												<br/>
              5. Set "File name" to 51.
												<br/>
              6. Set "Status" to 1.
												<br/>
												<br/>
        3.  The temp log is deleted by RG automatically, if you need
												<br/>
            or want a permanent log please specify a UL or DL Log.
												<br/>
												<br/>
            NOTE:  I realize some of you may know all there is to know
												<br/>
            about protocols and how they are handled by RG.  However,
												<br/>
            some do not.  Remember, if you do not specify all the above,
												<br/>
            your files will be transferred without error checking and
												<br/>
            statistics will not be updated.  Of course, you could forgo
												<br/>
            the above setup and RG will assume all files tranferred
												<br/>
            successfully.
												<br/>
												<br/>
        4.  Using the above setup may or may not work with currently
												<br/>
            released versions of RG or all external protocol programs.
												<br/>
												<br/>
Ok, one minor change, only use the lower case 'z' for the batch dlcode, not 
												<br/>
the upper case "Z".  The upper case 'Z" is for batch uploads and RG doesn't 
												<br/>
look at the ULCode for batch transfers.  Again, use the lower case 'Z" only 
												<br/>
for the batch dlcode.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade Bug Fix's/Enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  Batch uploaded files would normally be moved to the file area
												<br/>
      selected by the user.  However, if the system was setup
												<br/>
      to utilize *.DIZ files and the uploaded file contained a *.DIZ,
												<br/>
      the file was moved to the current file area regardless of the
												<br/>
      area selected by the user, fixed!
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  Added a sysop.log entry to indicate that start and end of scanning
												<br/>
      the protocol temp log for downloaded files.  These entries were
												<br/>
      also added for the start and end scanning of the BATCHDL.DAT if the
												<br/>
      temp log is not being utilized.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  If the protocol temp log is being utilized, an entry was made to
												<br/>
      the sysop.log that the batch download failed.  This has been
												<br/>
      changed to indicate that the file or return code wasn't found.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Example SysOp.Log For Batch Downloaded Files:
												<br/>
												<br/>
      (If protocol temp log is utilized).
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Start scan of "BATCH6.LOG" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
      File not found: TEST.EXE
												<br/>
      Return code not found: FILELIST.EXE
												<br/>
      Batch downloaded: PKZIP.EXE
												<br/>
      End scan of "BATCH6.LOG" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      NOTE:  The above changes should assist in locating errors
												<br/>
      related to inproper protocol file name and status position
												<br/>
      configuration.
												<br/>
												<br/>
      (If protocol temp log is not utilized).
												<br/>
												<br/>
      Start scan of "BATCHDL.DAT" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
      Batch Downloaded: TEST.EXE
												<br/>
      Batch downloaded: FILELIST.EXE
												<br/>
      Batch downloaded: PKZIP.EXE
												<br/>
      End scan of "BATCHDL.DAT" for batch downloaded files.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4.  If the user does not have enough time left online to complete
												<br/>
      a batch download they will be taken to the Batch DL Edit
												<br/>
      options (Clear, List & Remove).
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5.  If the filesize of an uploaded file were zero, the file would be
												<br/>
      awarded a file point, fixed (Example: OffLine Files).
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6.  If a file does not exist in the upload path during a local upload
												<br/>
      the user is prompted to make an offline entry. Previously a message
												<br/>
      was displayed before this question indicating that the file did
												<br/>
      not exist in the file directory.  This has been changed to indicate
												<br/>
      that the file does not exist in the upload path.  Also, there
												<br/>
      was no previous warning to the user that the file already exist in
												<br/>
      the file listing.  A message has now been added indicating that the
												<br/>
      file exists in the file listing. (Note: A duplicate entry will be
												<br/>
      added to the *.DIR file if the user selects "YES");
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7.  If a %F is utilized to pass the file name to DOS, it is checked to
												<br/>
      ensure it doesn't exceed the maximum DOS char length.  Only files
												<br/>
      up to this point are passed to DOS for processing, anything past
												<br/>
      this point in the Batch queue is not.  I added a sysop log entry
												<br/>
      for the first file in the queue that exceeds this length.  I did
												<br/>
      noticed that this process is only utilized for batch download
												<br/>
      transfers and may be required for the other transfer options.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  8.  Information about the name, size and download time are now
												<br/>
      displayed to the user about the Batch Download File Listing.  The
												<br/>
      total new download time is also displayed to the user.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  9.  The filesize was previously stored in the *.DIR file in 128 Byte
												<br/>
      blocks.  There was also a field used to store the remainder or
												<br/>
      bytes left over between 0-127.  This remainder was not fully
												<br/>
      implemented throughout the code to account for the total filesize.
												<br/>
      This impacted CPS rates and info displayed to the user about the real
												<br/>
      filesize and estimated download time.  I took a real hard look at
												<br/>
      this storage method and remembered that at one time, WWIV used this
												<br/>
      storage method for internal protocols.  Up till now, alot of extra
												<br/>
      code was required to convert the filesize to this dual storage
												<br/>
      method and alot was required to convert it back.  I saw no reason
												<br/>
      to continue this method.  Now, the filesize of a file contained
												<br/>
      in the *.DIR is stored as the actual filesize (LongInt Value).  All
												<br/>
      code related to this back and forth convertion has been removed.
												<br/>
      I provided an extra informational line for the 128/1024 block size
												<br/>
      that will be displayed when a file is selected for download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  10. The date was stored in the *.DIR file as both a longint value in
												<br/>
      seconds and the number of days since originally uploaded.  Once
												<br/>
      again, this required alot of extra code to convert back and forth
												<br/>
      and was only utilized in 2 places.  So, the number of days' since
												<br/>
      uploaded has been removed and is now calculated internally as
												<br/>
      needed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade Updates/Enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1.  ZM protocol will default to "/" vice "\" as directory path
												<br/>
      separators for *.log entries.  There is an option to convert
												<br/>
      this on the command line, however some sysops don't always read
												<br/>
      the documentation.  So, I added an internal conversion routine to
												<br/>
      look for this separator and automatically convert it.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2.  The message after adding a file to the batch download queue will now
												<br/>
      display the cumulative total of file points along with the number of
												<br/>
      files and download time.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3.  During a file download, the ratio of Uploads to Downloads is
												<br/>
      checked.  Although the ratio check of the total K bytes included
												<br/>
      the current file being downloaded, the ratio check of the total
												<br/>
      files did not include the current file being downloaded, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
												<br/>
Renegade Updates/Enhancements:
												<br/>
												<br/>
  1. A file can no longer be copied onto itself or moved to the same
												<br/>
     directory it currently resides in.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  2. In local mode, you must have CoSysOp access to move or copy an
												<br/>
     attached file or file selected for download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  3. I noticed that download and upload statistics were displayed for
												<br/>
     batch transfers even if "Log-off after file transfer was selected",
												<br/>
     but not for single download or upload transfers, fixed.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  4. Some items selected for download went thru the DLX procedure and
												<br/>
     some went directly to the send procedure.  Alot of extra code and
												<br/>
     variables were required for the send procedures everytime it was
												<br/>
     called.  Now, all download requests go thru the DLX procedure and
												<br/>
     then to the send procedure.  With this change, file downloading
												<br/>
     can be tracked for all downloads thru the same statistcal process.
												<br/>
     This includes, File attach, QWK, Unlisted and user archive.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  5. All regular downloads were checked to ensure the user met all
												<br/>
     security requirements, ratio, etc prior to the download.  However,
												<br/>
     if a user was exempt from certain ratio checks, the user was
												<br/>
     charged anyway for the download unless the file area was marked
												<br/>
     as No-Ratio.  This applied to users flagged as No UL/DL Ratio in
												<br/>
     the User Record, No UL/DL Ratio in the System record, etc.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  6. You will now be asked if the file exists on a CDROM for unlisted
												<br/>
     downloads.  This will alow for faster file transfers since the
												<br/>
     file is copied from the CDRom to the Temp Node Directory for
												<br/>
     download.
												<br/>
												<br/>
  7. The default file name for extracting text from a message has been
												<br/>
     changed from "MSG.TXT" to MSG
												<Node>.TXT.  Of course, you still
													<br/>
     have the option of changing this to whatever you like at the
													<br/>
     prompt.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8. For Offline mail transfers, the bbs will no longer attempt to copy
													<br/>
     the WELCOME, NEWS or GOODBYE file if they path to the file is
													<br/>
     blank.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
Renegade updates/enhancements:
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1. Fixed a bug related to the length of the dlcode/ulcode in the
													<br/>
     protocol editor.  The maximum length of this string is 6 chars.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2. No process was in place to prevent ul/dl statistical variable
													<br/>
     overrun, fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3. The color from the auto-logoff countdown procedure carried the
													<br/>
     last color to the next line, fixed.  This would only be noticed
													<br/>
     if the user escaped or cancelled the auto-logoff.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  5. The color from the scaninput procedure carried the last color to
													<br/>
     the next line, fixed. I noticed this with the batch download file
													<br/>
     remove command.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  6. Since files added to the batch downloaded queue are listed as such
													<br/>
     in the sysop.log, it only made since to list files removed from
													<br/>
     the batch download queue in the sysop.log as well. An entry to
													<br/>
     the sysop.log is also made when the batch download queue is
													<br/>
     cleared.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8. The uploader name/date and the message to the user to continue a
													<br/>
     resume file did not redisplay the file name when wrapped to the
													<br/>
     next page while utlizing the file list command, fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  9. I think I finally have some issues corrected with the file
													<br/>
     listing display.  Every now and then an extra file area
													<br/>
     header would display when not needed.  Also, sometimes the line
													<br/>
     counter would be off by one or two lines and push the file area
													<br/>
     header up one or two lines or completely off the screen.  I also
													<br/>
     noticed a line feed missing when the listing was aborted or
													<br/>
     exited normally.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
Renegade bug fix's/enhancements:
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1.  Due to space limitations, the file listing display will utilize
													<br/>
      bytes or kbytes depending on the file point settings in the
													<br/>
      system configuration. To be consistant, this process is now
													<br/>
      also being utilized for the file size displayed when a file is
													<br/>
      selected for download.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2.  When a file is selected for viewing, the user will be cautioned
													<br/>
      that the file is not checked to ensure it is an ascii text file
													<br/>
      and then asked if they would like to continue.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3.  The file listing download and add batch prompt has been cleaned
													<br/>
      up.  It would formally allow input of '-' by itself or the '-'
													<br/>
      proceeding or following a file number and alpha characters. The
													<br/>
      input of an invalid file number will now display a message to the
													<br/>
      user.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  4.  Adding a file to the batch queue from the file listing display
													<br/>
      will now display all the file information related to that file.
													<br/>
      It will also now properly check the file to ensure it is ok to
													<br/>
      download and send it thru the proper ratio checks.  I have to
													<br/>
      admit that this was an oversite on my part when I added the
													<br/>
      ability to select a file by number.  Basically it now goes
													<br/>
      directly thru the DLX procedure vice being added directly to
													<br/>
      the batch download queue.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
File download bug fixes/enhancements:
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1.  I fixed an issue with certain commands accessed from the
													<br/>
      file listing menu.  For example, the file edit command would
													<br/>
      allow you to edit whatever file you selected, but when you
													<br/>
      returned to the file list, it wouldn't return you to the
													<br/>
      proper record.  This appears to have been a long standing
													<br/>
      issue and I may have additional commands to correct that might
													<br/>
      be added to this menu.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2.  I added a new command to the file listing menu.  This command
													<br/>
      allows you to flag a file to edit like the batch flag or flag
													<br/>
      download.  The command is "L8".  You can select by number or
													<br/>
      range and go back and forth thru the range like you could if
													<br/>
      you were using the regular file edit command.  You must have
													<br/>
      File Sysop access to utilize this command.
													<br/>
													<br/>
<h1 id="09-30.6"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v09-30.6/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>
													<br/>
 1.  FIXED  - The Auto Time Display Flag (A) in the Menu Editor
													<br/>
               would not toggle on or off, this has been corrected.
													<br/>
               The Menu List Number and Menu Number was right
													<br/>
               justified to make for a better looking display and
													<br/>
               "(C)ommand editor" was added to the Prompt.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2. CHANGE  - In preparation for converting the Email System over
													<br/>
               to have the same look and feel of the message system,
													<br/>
               the following commands were changed in the Out Going
													<br/>
               Mail command:
													<br/>
													<br/>
               (P)revious was changed to (-)Previous
													<br/>
               (R)e-read was changed to (A)gain
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3.  FIXED  - The File Editor would give the option to delete
													<br/>
               all data files associated to an area when that
													<br/>
               area was deleted.  The problem was that it would only
													<br/>
               delete the *.DIR file and not the *.EXT or *.SCN files.
													<br/>
               The File Editor would also give the option of copying
													<br/>
               the data files over to the new directory when the "I"
													<br/>
               option was toggled in the File Area Flags.  The problem
													<br/>
               was that it would only copy the *.DIR file and not the
													<br/>
               *.EXT or *.SCN files, these have both been fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  4. CHANGE  - All extended file descriptions were previously saved to
													<br/>
               one file (EXTENDED.DAT).  This has been changed so that
													<br/>
               all file areas have their own individual *.EXT file.
													<br/>
               Should the EXTENDED.DAT file ever get corrupted, you could
													<br/>
               have possibly lost all extended description for your entire
													<br/>
               file area.  This will also help make it easier to add
													<br/>
               code for actually deleting the extended description for
													<br/>
               any files that you delete from a file area. Previously
													<br/>
               extended file descriptions were not actually deleted, only
													<br/>
               blocked out from access taking up hard drive space. That's
													<br/>
               969 bytes for every file!
													<br/>
													<br/>
  5.  FIXED  - The file move command still allowed moving a file to file
													<br/>
               area 0, which doesn't exists, fixed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  6.  ADDED  - Internal FILES.BBS importer.  New Menu CMD Key "FC" allows
													<br/>
               the scanning of all file areas configured inside of
													<br/>
               Renegade to import descriptions from anything that lists
													<br/>
               a FILES.BBS such as shareware CDs.  Also, instead of
													<br/>
               loading Renegade, load Renegade via cmd line -F to start
													<br/>
               the FILES.BBS importer without loading Renegade itself.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  7. FIXED   - All Menu Editor related bugs to adding/removing menus.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8. ADDED   - Option to allow the use of multiple "quote headers".
													<br/>
               With this option, you will be able to change the
													<br/>
               quote header on each base.  This will default to what
													<br/>
               ever is in the RENEGADE.LNG file.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  9. ADDED   - Option to allow the use of multiple "read prompt" menus
													<br/>
               per message area.  This will allow the SysOp to make
													<br/>
               seperate menu cmds for each base if need be.  This is
													<br/>
               mainly used if you want seperate conferences for
													<br/>
               certain bases or certain access and cmds for certain
													<br/>
               message areas.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 10. ADDED   - Option to allow the posting of a text file PER message
													<br/>
               area each time a user posts.  Yes, we know this will
													<br/>
               get old, but it will allow say a posting of "rules" to
													<br/>
               be displayed to the user at each posting thus washing
													<br/>
               your hands of a matter when the user says he has no
													<br/>
               idea he wasn't allowed to do something in a certain
													<br/>
               message area.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 11. CHANGE  - Extended the length of the message posts.  (ie:
													<br/>
               email/public/private) to 500 lines max.  The current
													<br/>
               default was set to 200, but you were getting no more
													<br/>
               than 50-60 depending on the amount of memory that was
													<br/>
               installed into the computer.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 12. UPDATE  - Removed most system menus to external string files.
													<br/>
               Also added a compiler for these new string files.
													<br/>
               This will allow the use of the software in any
													<br/>
               language and allow faster access to the menus than
													<br/>
               they were before.  We will shortly be pulling all
													<br/>
               strings and messages from within the code and
													<br/>
               making them external.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 13. ADDED   - New CMD Keys QQ - Random Quote Generator Display.
													<br/>
               Compile your quote text file with RGQUOTE and
													<br/>
               make a menu cmd and place the QUOTE file name
													<br/>
               in the options field to display the quotes one at
													<br/>
               a time.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 14. ADDED   - Toggle under system config to turn the above
													<br/>
               feature ON or OFF at logon.  This works much like
													<br/>
               the AutoMessage feature works.  Must have LGNQUOTE
													<br/>
               compiled and in the DATA directory for this option
													<br/>
               to work.  LGNQUOTE is compiled with RGQUOTE.EXE.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 15. ADDED   - Option in Message Base to turn ON or OFF tagline
													<br/>
               addition to the message you have just posted.  For
													<br/>
               this option to work TAGLINE.TXT must reside in the
													<br/>
               DATA directory and be compiled with TAGLINE.EXE.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 16. ADDED   - Auto Random quoting at the end of messages.  E-Mail
													<br/>
               Local, and Echo Message areas will automatically
													<br/>
               have a quote added at the bottom of the message.
													<br/>
               This can be toggled ON/OFF on each message base
													<br/>
               and now EMAIL.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 17. ADDED   - The E-Mail Subsystem has been added to the Message
													<br/>
               base editor.  This will be record 0, which you can
													<br/>
               edit certain features and strings.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 18. ADDED   - Option to add to quote file at logon via system
													<br/>
               config toggle.  This will create a file called
													<br/>
               *.NEW (Taking on the firstname of whichever
													<br/>
               quotefile a quote was added to.) and then you
													<br/>
               can then copy new quotes over into the correct
													<br/>
               file and recompile it.  Please note, you MUST
													<br/>
               erase this file when you are done with it or it
													<br/>
               will continue to append to the end of the file
													<br/>
               and take up space.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 18. ADDED   - Option to add a quote to E-Mail or a Message is
													<br/>
               now asked after the message is saved.  This can
													<br/>
               be toggled ON/OFF in the message base editor.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 19. FIXED   - Standardize the SysOp.Log File - The log file
													<br/>
               was cutting off a user if they logged on around
													<br/>
               midnight of that night.  They were either tossed
													<br/>
               into the night before or the current one.  This
													<br/>
               has no been corrected to be sorted into the
													<br/>
               correct file.
													<br/>
													<br/>
													<br/>
<h1 id="06-30.6"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v06-30.6/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>
													<br/>
													<br/>
  1.  FIXED  - /S command in teleconference not displaying the
													<br/>
               correct information (or any actually).  This has
													<br/>
               now been corrected.  Basically fixed all commands
													<br/>
               in the teleconference to work properly.  Removed
													<br/>
               all 0-, 5-, 1- and such debugging code as well.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  2.  FIXED  - Total Free Space Showing on the WFC Screen is now
													<br/>
               displaying correctly up to 999.9 megs.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  3.  CHANGE - The Menu system is now non-existant as text files.
													<br/>
               They have been converted over to DATA files with
													<br/>
               a new MENU EDITOR added into Renegade.  This frees
													<br/>
               up from internal memory and speeds things up a bit.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  4.  ADDED  - Added option under S. System Config, A. Main BBS Config,
													<br/>
               K. System Menus.  This is where it will tell Renegade
													<br/>
               which are the main system menus and that are not allowed
													<br/>
               to be deleted.  This also plays into the effect of
													<br/>
               all the numbered menus now instead of names.  The
													<br/>
               included Menu Converter will take care of this and
													<br/>
               any/all menus you have.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  5.  FIXED  - Annonying "Cannot Load NODEx.DAT file" error.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  6.  UPDATE - File/Message/Protocol/Event Editors to more closely
													<br/>
               reflect the look and feel of the menu editor.  Thus,
													<br/>
               giving things a more universal look and feel.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  7.  FIXED  - The option to edit the arctype in the File Menu.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  8.  FIXED  - The Shell to DOS in the WFC was a "J" (Not listed) and
													<br/>
               renamed it to "D" to conform with the WFC Screen.
													<br/>
													<br/>
  9.  FIXED  - The option for using a "U" to determine if you were
													<br/>
               doing anything with batch upload command or batch
													<br/>
               download commands compared against a capital "U", the
													<br/>
               problem was that the file editor allows lower case
													<br/>
               entry of this "U", added and allcaps to the menu were
													<br/>
               it compared the two.  Didn't change the file editor
													<br/>
               to still allow lower case for the options.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 10. REMOVE  - The option to PRINT SysOp Log files.  This command
													<br/>
               only printed to the LPT port.  Really, who has a
													<br/>
               LPT Printer anymore?  Command removed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 11. CHANGE  - Removed all extra spacing after internal prompts
													<br/>
               left.   ie: before "Menu Prompt :"  now "Menu Prompt:"
													<br/>
													<br/>
 12. CHANGE  - 200 Menu commands are now allowed per each menu
													<br/>
               set.  This was defaulted to 100.  200 Should be more
													<br/>
               than enough for any users.  If you need more, you
													<br/>
               need a life! ;)
													<br/>
													<br/>
 13.  FIXED  - Batch Files: Any files left in the Batch Queue after
													<br/>
               logoff would not be stored for download after the
													<br/>
               next logon to the BBS.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 14.  CHANGE - Overlays are revamped and the param switch -D for 
													<br/>
               disabling EMX/XMS and -O for setting the OvrExtraSize
													<br/>
               (Default 64K).  The -D switch was added incase for
													<br/>
               some odd reason an EMS/XMS driver is not detected
													<br/>
               and Renegade will not load.  By using -D you will
													<br/>
               be able to load Renegade's Overlay to DISK and
													<br/>
               still be able to access the BBS to correct the error.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 14.  CHANGE - TOGGLES.DAT file is removed and is added internal to
													<br/>
               Renegade.  This effects two options.  The option of
													<br/>
               the access for the laston.dat file needs to be rest
													<br/>
               if you changed it.  The toggles are all there and
													<br/>
               must be reset as a few were added.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 15.  ADDED  - User Editor Option '/' key.  This is where you can set
													<br/>
               all defaults for a newuser up to answering all the
													<br/>
               newuser questions, the autoval is still there for after
													<br/>
               these questions are answered.  Prior to this update,
													<br/>
               you couldn't change anything before a newuser was
													<br/>
               validated since they were hard coded in the program.
													<br/>
               Anything you do in Rec 0 (Zero) will carry over past
													<br/>
               autoval if the autoval didn't change the option.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 16.  FIXED  - Display issues with the protocols. The RENEGADE.LNG file
													<br/>
               allowed entry of PROTLIST which displayed a list of
													<br/>
               protocols in addition to the PROT*.ASC files or internal
													<br/>
               protocols. Either delete the PROTLIST entry from
													<br/>
               RENEGADE.LNG or delete PROT*.ASC from the MISC Directory.
													<br/>
               You may also now hide protocols if you do not wish a
													<br/>
               discription to be displayed to the user.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 17.  MISC   - The internal variable for NODE which should have been
													<br/>
               a byte variable was in fact either a word or integer
													<br/>
               variable.  Reduced file reads when listing protocols
													<br/>
               from 3 reads down to 2 reads.  This should make things
													<br/>
               abit faster.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 18.  FIXED  - When updating the node, a comparison of the Node
													<br/>
               number to the Activity was made to set invisible
													<br/>
               mode instead of being compared Node to Node. Removed
													<br/>
               this since Invisible mode is set at Logon and
													<br/>
               via a menu comand.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 19.  FIXED  - The length of the path/filename string for unlisted
													<br/>
               downloads was 78 and the length of the string in
													<br/>
               the batchdl was 65.  Changed both to a length of 52
													<br/>
               (40=Path/12-Filename) to conform with other
													<br/>
               path/filenames used throughout the file system.  A
													<br/>
               length of 78 would have been a waist of space since
													<br/>
               most dl's are listed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 20.  FIXED  - The download time is now properly updated when
													<br/>
               batchdl's were saved for the next logon.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 21.  CHANGE - The node activity would report that you were in a
													<br/>
               door when uploading files.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 22.  FIXED  - Certain protocols when selected were passed to the
													<br/>
               seek/read procedures that were negative causing a
													<br/>
               runtime error of 100.  This has now been corrected so
													<br/>
               that only numbers from zero and above are passed to
													<br/>
               these procedures.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 23.  FIXED  - Event Editor - If setting an event to SORT FILES,
													<br/>
               this event would never run as the command to SORT
													<br/>
               FILES (ie: S) was not a valid option.  This has been
													<br/>
               corrected.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 24.  UPDATE - The NEW bulletins displayed at logon would occasionaly
													<br/>
               display 0's (Zero) instead of just the bulletins that
													<br/>
               were actually updated since your last logon.  This has
													<br/>
               now been corrected.  Leading zero's were added to those
													<br/>
               bulletin numbers below 10 to make for a better looking
													<br/>
               display when listed.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 25.  ADDED  - Added Menu Option TD to erase BBS's from the BBS
													<br/>
               Listing.  This will be listed in the updated
													<br/>
               MENUCMD.ASC file in the next release.
													<br/>
													<br/>
 25.  ADDED  - Added Menu Command Option (N.) to each menu command.
													<br/>
               This command will update the node activity for each
													<br/>
               command.  If someone is playing LORD, you can set N.
													<br/>
               to "Playing LORD" in the same command as your batch
													<br/>
               file is placed.  No more need to use the NW command
													<br/>
               before and after a cmd is run to update the
													<br/>
               multinode information to Renegade's Who's Online.
													<br/>
													<br/>
                          ********** NOTE ***********
													<br/>
													<br/>
               Activity Field is now able to be a MAXIMUM of 50
													<br/>
               charcters long.
													<br/>
													<br/>
26.    ADDED - New Toggle Option.  Users will now have the option
													<br/>
               of answering a question to be able to logon the BBS
													<br/>
               after forgetting their password.  This can be
													<br/>
               toggled ON/OFF via the toggles menu.  Once the user
													<br/>
               correctly answers the question, they then will be
													<br/>
               able to set a new password before logging onto the
													<br/>
               BBS.  A Mininote to the SysOp will be sent as well
													<br/>
               as a sysop log file line will be written.
													<br/>
													<br/>
27.    ADDED - Sysop Logging for the User Lister and Sysop Logging
													<br/>
               for Todays Callers.  Just to show what the user
													<br/>
               was doing while online. (Nice to know once in a
													<br/>
               while that a command is being used. 
													<G>)
														<br/>
														<br/>
28.    FIXED - The File Sort Routine was setup to access File
														<br/>
               Area 0 which Doesn't exist, so this was changed to
														<br/>
               File Area 01.
														<br/>
														<br/>
29.    FIXED - Logoff time was not properly being passed to the
														<br/>
               SYSOP.LOG file.  Now, the sysop.log file will show
														<br/>
               user logon time, logon node number, what they did
														<br/>
               while online, and logoff time of that node.
														<br/>
														<br/>
30.   CHANGE - Logoff entry in Sysop.Log now indicates Node Number.
														<br/>
														<br/>
31.    FIXED - The Forgot PW question will now redisplay and can
														<br/>
               be edited without retyping the whole damn thing! ;)
														<br/>
														<br/>
32.   CHANGE - The User List can now be viewed a number of different
														<br/>
               ways.  You can view the list via choosing several
														<br/>
               different options to sort it by.  Location, Sex,
														<br/>
               State, etc.  Or you still can view it as it was for
														<br/>
               the last 1000 years. ;)
														<br/>
														<br/>
33.   CHANGE - File Area Toggle Scan Flags (Command)
														<br/>
														<br/>
               Removed the "Q" for quit, pressing 
														<Enter> now quits
															<br/>
               this command and the command no longer scrolls on the
															<br/>
               screen like it did when the "Q" was required.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Reduced the actual toggling of the scan flags from 3
															<br/>
               separate processes down to just one procedure.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Pressing "-" alone will now exit vice scrolling the
															<br/>
               command.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Reduced the input string from 15 down to 9 chars
															<br/>
               since the max range that can be entered is xxxx-xxxx.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Added an input background.
															<br/>
															<br/>
34.   CHANGE - File Area New Scan Date (Command)
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Removed the extra Line Feed from RENEGADE.LNG File.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Added error checking for date entered past the
															<br/>
               current date.
															<br/>
															<br/>
               Reduce the input string from 160 down to 10 chars
															<br/>
               since the max length of the date is xx/xx/xxxx.
															<br/>
															<br/>
35.    ADDED - File Tagging to the File areas.  File Names can now
															<br/>
               be downloaded or added to Batch via a simple number
															<br/>
               instead of typing out the full filename each time.
															<br/>
               Batch downloads can be downloaded via XX-YY cmd.
															<br/>
               ie:  4-7, would download files numbered 4, 5, 6, 7.
															<br/>
															<br/>
36.    ADDED - AR Flags - You now have the option to press ? when
															<br/>
               editing user AR Flags.  ARFLAGS.ANS/.ASC is to be put
															<br/>
               in the MISC directory and is used by the SysOp so
															<br/>
               they know which flag is for what and who.  Just a
															<br/>
               simple little reminder.  Hope this helps some.
															<br/>
															<br/>
37.   CHANGE - File Points are now ranged from 0-999 to more closely
															<br/>
               reflect an acutal file point system.  I just can't
															<br/>
               see someone having to pay 32000 points for a file. ;)
															<br/>
															<br/>
38.   CHANGE - At logon, you will be prompted to download files
															<br/>
               in which you have left in your batch queue after
															<br/>
               last logoff.
															<br/>
															<br/>
39.   CHANGE - File Prompt Header - The File Prompt header will
															<br/>
               redisplay at each screen.  No longer will you have
															<br/>
               to wonder which file area you are in.  This gives
															<br/>
               the file system a nice rounded out look as well.
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
<h1 id="05-19.4"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v05-19.4/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>

															<br/>
															<br/>
 1.  CHANGE -   Updated Copyright notice to reflect the new year.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 2.  FIXED  -   Slight Memory leak in v01-10.4/DOS.  This in turn would
															<br/>
                cause Renegade to eventuatly eat up all availble memory
															<br/>
                in a few years of use if the computer was never rebooted.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 3.  ADDED  -   /F MENUCMD to disable MCI Codes from displaying inside
															<br/>
                of a text file.  This MENUCMD compliments the -F CMD Key.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 4.  ADDED  -   Option /M when entering a message to turn on or off
															<br/>
                using MCI Codes per message.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 5.  ADDED  -   Added option to allow the SysOp access to the amount
															<br/>
                of time to give each timeslice.  This may help some systems
															<br/>
                in which Renegade hogs a lot of CPU (ie: Windows 2000). If
															<br/>
                you do not have much of a problem with sluggish performance
															<br/>
                it is suggested that you leave this option at the default
															<br/>
                setting. (10-40 optimal setting)
															<br/>
															<br/>
                [System Config -> D. System Variables -> V. Time Slices]
															<br/>
															<br/>
 6.  FIXED  -   Slight problem when displaying "NEW" bulletins to users
															<br/>
                when they first logon.  Renegade would display 22 of them
															<br/>
                across, then start putting each new one on a new line.
															<br/>
															<br/>
 7.  REMOVE -   Removed "Digiboard" support in the codebase.  Really,
															<br/>
                who would use one of those now-a-days anyways with a DOS
															<br/>
                based BBS?  If this is an issue for anyone, please e-mail
															<br/>
                us and we'll take care of it for you.
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
 8.  ADDED  -   Added option to System Config to post the BBS's telnet
															<br/>
                URL.  This is under System Conifg, Option A Main BBS Config.
															<br/>
                Just a cosmetic add, as before you could only type in a
															<br/>
                telephone number for the BBS.  Now you have a choice. ;)
															<br/>
															<br/>
 9.  ADDED  -   Added ~TN MCI Code to BBSME.ASC/ANS and BBSMN.ASC/ANS
															<br/>
                to reflect the new Telnet address line to the BBS list.
															<br/>
															<br/>
10.  CHANGE -   Changed the follow command keys to reflect new BBS
															<br/>
                list format change.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                       {  See Below for list of CMD Keys  }
															<br/>
															<br/>
                OB : Changed to CMD Key   TV   {short view of bbslist}
															<br/>
                OA : Changed to CMD Key   TA   {Add to bbslist}
															<br/>
															<br/>
                Added the following CMD Keys to be able to have more
															<br/>
                control over the BBS List.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                TA  : BBSList Add           {formally CMD Key OB}
															<br/>
                TE  : BBSList Edit 
															<br/>
                TV  : BBSList Short View    {formally CMD Key OV}
															<br/>
                TX  : BBSList Extended View {formally CMD Key OV}
															<br/>
															<br/>
                { Updated MENUCMD.ASC file to reflect these changes }
															<br/>
															<br/>
11.  CHANGE -   BBS Listing is now scriptable.  This means that you
															<br/>
                now can add just about any question for the BBS you wish.
															<br/>
                MCI Codes reflect the different questions (1-8) to display
															<br/>
                when a user views the BBS List.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                { Added BBSLIST.SCR file to reflect this update }
															<br/>
															<br/>
                *** BBSLIST.SCR MUST BE IN THE \BBS\MISC DIRECTORY ***
															<br/>
															<br/>
12.  ADDED  -   %xA / %xB / %xC / %xD / %xE / %xF for extra definable
															<br/>
                sysop strings in the BBSLIST.SCR file.
															<br/>
															<br/>
                                x:= to the following values.
															<br/>
                a = 8 chars / b = 30 / c = 30 / d = 40 / e = 60 / f = 60
															<br/>
															<br/>
                Also added %S2 for and extra line of descrition of the
															<br/>
                BBS.  Changed the way it stores the SOFTWARE. It's all
															<br/>
                in capital letters now.  Also, added that if can't find
															<br/>
                BBSMN.ASC it will echo back that in the sysop log and
															<br/>
                just print out the bbslist.sysopname, etc and proceed.
															<br/>
															<br/>
13.  ADDED  -   BBS*.ASC New MCI - ~WS (website) ~RN (Record Number)
															<br/>
															<br/>
14.  CHANGE -   -TG and -TS command line loaders for Renegade are
															<br/>
                now simply just -T for all telnet connections.  Unless
															<br/>
                you are using COM/IP as your emulator which the command
															<br/>
                line changed to -TC (ie: renegade.exe -n4 -tc).
															<br/>
															<br/>
16.  UPDATE -   The Official Renegade Home page is now located at URL:
															<br/>
                              http://www.renegadebbs.net
															<br/>
															<br/>
17.  REMOVE -   Removed the "Moving xx to xx" from writing to the
															<br/>
                SYSOPx.LOG file.  Saved some clutter there. ;)
															<br/>
															<br/>
18.  FIXED  -   The Telnet URL will now save correctly in the
															<br/>
                system config and not constantly erase itself.
															<br/>
                Will have to set for each node.
															<br/>
															<br/>
19.  CHANGE -   Bulletins now compare Time and Date of Files vs Time
															<br/>
                and Date of last logon to display as NEW.
															<br/>
															<br/>
20.  CHANGE -   NODE*.ASC instead of showning a '-' when a user isn't
															<br/>
                on a node it will echo back the node number for ~NN, then
															<br/>
                for ~AV it will display 'Y'. MCI Code ~AC is a 20 Chars
															<br/>
                String and ~UN is a 36 character string.
															<br/>
															<br/>
21.  CHANGE -   The Caller ID switch is now -ID instead of just -I
															<br/>
                Also -IP puts the IP (if present) into the Caller ID field
															<br/>
                in the User Editor and anything to do with Caller ID.
															<br/>
															<br/>
22.  ADDED  -   The String Editor is now removed from Renegade.  All
															<br/>
                strings within the editor are now EXTERNAL.  We will
															<br/>
                slowly be removing all strings from within Renegade's
															<br/>
                code and making them external for easy editing!  Also
															<br/>
                created DUMP to "dump" the STRING.DAT file to the
															<br/>
                editable language file. (data\renegade.lng)
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
<h1 id="01-10.4"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v01-10.4/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>
															<br/>
															<br/>
  1.  FIXED  - Bulletins - Now will correctly display if a bulletin
															<br/>
               is new or not to the user per call and are sorted
															<br/>
               in numerical order.  ie: (2, 7, 19, 22) instead of
															<br/>
               (22, 2, 19, 7).
															<br/>
															<br/>
  2.  ADDED  - (-T, /T) Toggle.  This will inturn toggle all baud
															<br/>
               rate speeds to show as "TELNET".  This also disables
															<br/>
               most comm routines relating to logoffs.  With -T
															<br/>
               added to loading Renegade, it will no longer pause
															<br/>
               for a set number of seconds before the BBS will
															<br/>
               hang the user up.  DO NOT use this command on
															<br/>
               dialup nodes!  Use this on TELNET ONLY NODES!!!!
															<br/>
															<br/>
   3. REVISED  (-T, /T) (-TG, /TG) (-TS, /TS) Load Toggle.
															<br/>
               This will inturn toggle the MCI Code ~SP in
															<br/>
               the last caller ANSI/ASCII to show 'BAUD'.
															<br/>
               (-T, /T) will do the hang-up procedure on a
															<br/>
               regular log-off for COM/IP.  (-TG, /TG) & (-TS, /TS)
															<br/>
               will bypass the passing of the ATH0 hangup string
															<br/>
               to the fossil/com port and will work with GameSrv
															<br/>
               or Synchronet respectivly.  This fix's issues of
															<br/>
               slow hangups while doing a telnet session.
															<br/>
               DO NOT use this command with dialup nodes!
															<br/>
															<br/>
   3. FIXED  - Fixed Toggles Menu and added warning screen about
															<br/>
               the use of certain toggles and what else should be
															<br/>
               changed or certain users may not be able to log
															<br/>
               back on to the BBS.  (ie:  If you have the BBS
															<br/>
               check for birthday's and have the toggle to ask
															<br/>
               for the birthday at new logon set to NO, the user
															<br/>
               will not be able to logon the BBS since he will not
															<br/>
               have a birthday set in the user record.)
															<br/>
															<br/>
   4. FIXED  - Added Time Slice Routines to certain functions in
															<br/>
               Renegade where it awaits for a user input.  This
															<br/>
               SHOULD fix some slow downs while running under
															<br/>
               some version of Windows.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   5. FIXED  - Fixed Memory problems with downloads and swapping
															<br/>
               Renegade out of memory which in turn caused some
															<br/>
               doors not to function.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   6. CHANGE - Changed all file sizes in Renegade to now show as
															<br/>
               Kilobyte (KB), and Megabytes (MB) instead of just
															<br/>
               bytes. (ie: 64,564 bytes NOW DISPLAYS AS 64.5 KB)
															<br/>
               Also changes to the WFC Screen to reflect this.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   7. FIXED  - Fixed upload Limit of 8.1 MB.  Now, will show
															<br/>
               files with sizes up to 1.9 GB.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   8. FIXED  - Fixed the AR, AC Flags [- OF -] toggle command to
															<br/>
               NOT be case sensitive.
															<br/>
															<br/>
   9. ADDED  - MCI Code telnet - This MCI Code shows the users speed,
															<br/>
               ie: Telnet, Local, or Actual Baud Rate.
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
															<br/>
<h1 id="11-26.3"><b style="color:#FFFFFF">----[ Changes in v11-26.3/DOS ]----</h1>													<br/></b>

(Nov 26, 2003)
															<br/>
															<br/>
  01 -  Made NEWUSER Questions Configurable.  Only questions that are
															<br/>
        required are the User Handle, and User Password.  These toggles
															<br/>
        will be kept in a file called TOGGLES.DAT in the DATA directory.
															<br/>
        If this file is deleted, Renegade will remake the file with the
															<br/>
        defaults. (System Config, N - New User Toggles)
															<br/>
															<br/>
  02 -  Extended FILE_ID.DIZ Description length from 10 lines to 20
															<br/>
        lines.  Read UPDATE.DOC (VERY, VERY IMPORTANT!!!)
															<br/>
															<br/>
  03 -  Fixed:  When a user was downloading or uploading a file, Renegade
															<br/>
        still showed the user was able to be paged to chat.
															<br/>
															<br/>
  04 -  Fixed:  Bug in Renemail which wouldn't allow importing of netmail
															<br/>
        from a FrontEnd Mailer.
