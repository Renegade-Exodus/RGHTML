<pre>
 ■  Miscellaneous Code clean up.<br>
 ■  New Menu CMDKEY, HQ  Hangs up User and quits the BBS to DOS.

 ■  New Menu CMDKEY, HD  Displays GOODBYE.ANS/.ASC to the user
    upon slow logoff as before without the YES/NO Lightbar prompt
    being used.

 ■  New Menu CMDKEY, 1E  Edit Oneliners.  This will allow you to
    edit or remove onleiners you do not approve of on your BBS.

 ■  Miscellaneous Color Fixes within some prompts.

 ■  Updated miscellaneous bullet character "■" infront of titles and
    information after downloads finish to quit changing to a ? each
    time the source was compiled. :)

 ■  Updated File Description Search functions to log what user was
    searching for in the SYSOP.LOG file.

 ■  New Menu CMDKEY, DX  Output ALL Door Files at the same time.
    Useful when running a program that uses one and spawns into
    another program that only works with different drop file in the
    same batch file.

 ■  Found and FINALLY killed bug that causes NTVDM crashes when using
    any program that used the ComPort directly.

 ■  New Renegade starting parameter, -K  causes Renegade to drop to
    DOS on all disconnects from the BBS.  Useful if you are using RG
    as a door server.  Updated Renegade -? Help screen to
    reflect this.  This will act the same as -T except it will drop
    to DOS and not the WFC screen.

 ■  *MORE* Color Fixes within some prompts.

 ■  Updated Netmail area internal display prompts and procedures.

 ■  Updated & Bullet proofed Renemail thanks to Nick Andre.

 ■  Renemail new option, -X  which will pull messages from
    Renegade's data files and converts it back to *.MSGs for those
    wanting to do %RESCAN and pickup past messages.

 ■  New Renegade starting parameter, -R  causes Renegade to update
    the MULTNODE.DAT file with any information you want from the 
    command prompt.

 ■  Usage: Renegade -R [Node number] [ON or OFF] [Username] [Activity]

    Renegade -R 5 ON D'Bridge Tossing Mail
    Will update Node 5 to say D'Bridge and status of Tossing Mail

    Renegade -R 5 OFF
    This would clear the node status of node 5.

 ■  Removed some old Error Logging to the file areas.

    A.  Not really a Renegade Fix, but added Lee Woodridge to the
        Renegade Development Team.

    A.  Added internal OneLiner Program.

        New Files :

          ONELH.* - Oneliners Header (Optional)
          ONELM.* - Oneliners Middle (Required!!)
          ONELT.* - Oneliners Footer (Optional)

        ONELM.* MCI Codes :

         ~AN (Anon - Yes/No)           ~AT (Anon - True/False)
         ~DA (Date Added)              ~OL (The Oneliner)
         ~RN (Record Number)           ~U# (User ID with '#')
         ~U1 (User ID without '#')     ~UN (User Name)
         ~UL (User Name Lowercase)
         ~US (First 2 Letters of Username - iNiQUiTY Style)
         ~UU (First 2 letters of username lowercase)

        New MENUCMD Keys For OneLiners:

            1L - Display Oneliner (Header/Footer & all Oneliners)

            1R - Display Random line from Oneliner File

    F.  Local file upload bug.  Before when uploading locally with
        the FU command key after 1 upload it would stop and you would
        have to repeat the process.  It somehow become broken over
        the years and no one said anything.   Now it will upload all
        files without stopping if a *.* is entered for the filename.

    F.  When a file was moved, if it was a dupe, the file wasn't 
	moved but the description was.  This is no longer the case.
        If the file is a dupe, nothing is moved.  This prevents dupe
	file descriptions.  

    F.  The (~TO) MCI Code in the LASTM.ASC file would display a 
	random number when viewed while the user was still online.
	This has now been updated to show " - " until the user logs
	off and the correct time online will be shown by this MCI 
	code.

    A.  New MCI Code - %XYaa;bb% (aa=01-80 Left to right) and
        (bb=01-25 Top to Bottom).  Allows format positioning of the
        cursor without the need of having your ANSI menu file do it,
        for you.  Say you wanted the word "Hello!" to appear in the
        middle of the screen, it would be used as such:

            %XY40;12%Hello!

        The above would move the cursor to space 40, line 12, and put
        your text of "Hello!" starting there.

    U.  The Auto Message is now configurable.  Like the oneliner,
        last caller, user list, etc.   It has a header, main, and a
        footer file in the MISC directory.

        The auto message is now saved as "AUTOM.ASC" instead of
        "AUTO.ASC" to make it conform to the rest of the code base.

        New Files :

          AUTOH.* - Auto Message Header (Optional)
          AUTOM.* - (Can be made, but automagically made when a auto)
                    (message is created.  This is your auto message.)
          AUTOT.* - Auto Message Footer (Optional)

     U.  Disabled Forgot password response for Co-SyOp and above.
         This would prevent someone from trying to logon as the SysOp
         and trying the forgot password question answer and resetting
         it so they can logon as the SysOp.

     U.  Can now scroll through the node settings without having to
         load each node seperately.

     A.  Added System Config Menu Option (N). SysOp Macros.  They were
         moved from another submenu to make a more cleaner look and 
   	 easier to find.

     F.  Removed System Config and File Area Editors strings from
         the language files to prevent unwanted access.  Also removed 
	 the MCI codes that ran these menus (which would've caused a 
	 problem in certain instances.)

     A.  YES/NO LightBar options added to YES/NO Prompt MENUCMD

     F.  Split Screen Chat now auto scrolls and stays within it's
         borders.  Also added help commands that are listed in the 
	 center of the chat screen.
  
     U.  When the SysOp breaks into chat via a "Chat Page" with the
         SpaceBar the split screen chat will auto load.  Otherwise, 
	 the normal line chat will be used.

                         Chat commands are as follows:
                 ALT-C - Line Chat      ALT-S - Split Screen Chat

     U.  Teleconference strings are now located within the RGLNG
         text file instead of the Node setup options screen in the 
	 system configuration section.
     
     U.  RENEGADE.EXE /? now shows what command line parameters are
         available to run along with a short message of what each 
	 does.

     U.  All strings are now combined into RGLNG.TXT.

     A.  New MENUCMD  *T  to toggle SysOp Chat Availability without
         the use of the SCROLL LOCK key.   Also, new MCI Code %SA to 
	 show if the sysop is avaliable or not.

     U.  Removed more strings from Renegade and added them to
         RGLNG.TXT for more editing for the SysOp.

     U.  Redid NewUser Toggle Questions Menu to add all toggles
         in one place.  Remember to clear your all of your toggles 
	 after you upgrade so the new changes will take effect.  
	 Cmd Key of * will do this for you.

     U.  User #0 (Default account) can now be cleared for all user
         options.  Cmd Key of $ will allow you to clear out which
         fields you want to be blank instead of having a "." or some
         random text in the user data file. This is also a good idea
	 to once you upgrade as the forgot password question more than
         likely has a space in it's field and more than likely won't
         work until you clear the prompt with the $ cmd key.

     U.  Updated OP Menu CMD options.  Be sure to change these in
         your NEWINFO menu and PERSONAL info menus or else what you
         have listed won't match what it does. ;)
 

                         New OP Menu CMD Options:

                1  Handle
                2  Real Name
                3  Country

               28  * UNUSED *
               29  * UNUSED *
               30  * UNUSED *

     U.  Updated SysOp LOG Output.  Now shows a bit more info on
         what the user was doing while online.  Such as what menus
         were accessed (along with menu titles & numbers) and a time
         stamp on when things were accessed.

     F.  Finally tracked down bug that would lock up a newscan
         if you had more than 255 files in a base.

     U.  New MCI Code %OL -- Light Bars On/Off.  This replaces
         the file and message light bar mci codes.

     F.  Fixed bug that allowed the user to Email deleted users.
         Co-SysOp and higher can still email (for what, testing?)
         deleted users.  A Prompt will ask if you wish to or not.

     U.  Added Several Email Error strings to RGLNG

     U.  Top 10 Files Listing now asks if you would like to
         download one of these files from the menu.  If you select 
	 YES you will be given the option to download file 1-10.

     U.  More strings added to RGLNG.TXT file to edit for your
         pleasure. ;)

     F.  User Record now correctly updates stats when a user
         dowloads or uploads a file.

     U.  Increased MAX system menus to 200 from 100.

     A.  Added additional Sub-Menus to System Toggles in
         System Config.

    and did a color change.  Couldn't stand that Blue Background 
    anymore. Also updated the copyright notice.

 U. New Renegade BBS WWW Home - http://www.rgbbs.info

 U. Finally noticed the "New Scanning of Files" prompt was not 
    exported to RGLNG.TXT.  Added this option, so you can now change 
    your "Scanning File Base Name ... " prompt to more closely match 
    your BBS.

    Will include a new RGLNG.TXT file in the update, or you can just
    add the option to the end of your RGLNG.TXT file called 
    NEW_FILE_SCANNING

    $New_File_Scanning
    %CLScanning ... [%FB - %HM]@
    $

 U. Updated RGLNG.EXE to allow for the new addition as well.

    checking. The Files.BBS importer can be run by running 
    RENEGADE -F at the prompt.

- BACK UP FIRST!!  This is to update from v1.19a ONLY

- Copy MISC.ZIP to your \RENEGADE\MISC directory and UNZIP
  and overwrite all files.  (Or update your own.)

- Change to \RENEGADE\DATA directory and if BBSLIST.OLD
  exist, please erase it.

- Copy FIXBBSL.EXE to \RENEGADE directory and run it to
  update the current BBS Listings.

It's always a good idea, but just for safety, do it before you update.
Nothing should go wrong, but there is always that chance.

Copy RENEGADE.EXE and RENEGADE.OVR to your main Renegade BBS
Directory and overwrite your previous files.

Copy RGUPDATE.EXE to your Main Renegade BBS Directory.  This file
will update some code in the RENEGADE.DAT file and correct some
verbage interally.  This MUST be run or you may have problems
down the road.

Run RGUPDATE.EXE, once it is completed, load up your new version
of Renegade BBS!

Thanks for choosing to run one of the BEST BBS packages out there!

======================== UPGRADE INFO ===========================
=================================================================

       Unzip this upgrade package into your main Renegade
       directory.  Run RGUPDATE.EXE to update miscellaneous
       data files and RENEGADE.DAT file.  Once this is done,
       the file can be erased.

       This is a "HotFix" to solve the XMS not loaded problem
       that a new windows update caused.  This should fix
       all issues with Renegade not loading.


=================================================================
======================== UPGRADE INFO ===========================
=================================================================


Remember to add the following switches to your command
line to load Renegade properly.

Also, if using WinXP check your _DEFAULT.PIF file in
your main Windows directory.  Make sure all memory
settings are set to AUTO instead of NONE, or else RG
may or may not load.

Loading "RENEGADE -D" will load Renegade with Overlays
writing to DISK until you fix the memory issue with
the .PIF file in WinXP.  Do NOT run Renegade like this
all the time or the program will run very slow compared
to how it is supposed to run in memory.   This is just
a quick "fix" to be able to load the BBS and make sure
everything is working if you are getting a "Memory
Error."

We have included TEXT.ZIP as defaults that are needed.  Make sure
you append these to any "custom" strings you have so you will have
all strings to date. These should be the ONLY files in your TEXT
directory if you choose to create a seperate directory for these 
files.

Option 9. below should be changed in RGCFG.TXT to reflect the name
change from "RAM Drive/MulitNode Path" to "Strings/Text Directory".
You can keep the same path, but whatever the path is set in Option 9,
is where Renegade will look for ALL strings.


-=-=-=- RGCFG.TXT file  --  System Config Bottom of Screen -=-=-=-

0. Main data files dir.    : %PD
1. Miscellaneous Files dir.: %PM
2. Message file storage dir: %P1
3. Nodelist (Version 7) dir: %P2
4. Log files/trap files dir: %PL
5. Temporary directory     : %PT
6. Protocols directory     : %PP
7. Archivers directory     : %P7
8. File attach directory   : %PF
9. Strings directory       : %P3



  ONCE THIS IS DONE, BE SURE TO RUN -- RGLNG.EXE -- TO RECOMPILE
  YOUR STRINGS OR ELSE YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES UNTIL YOU DO!!


=================================================================
======================== UPGRADE INFO ===========================
=================================================================


New MENUCMD's to turn ON/OF lightbar options.  Add these
to your Personal Info Menu for user selection if you wish.

1.  FIXED  -  Minor issue with log files. Anytime a QWK was 
	      downloaded garbage was thrown to the log file.  This 
	      has been corrected and will now show correctly what 
	      was done.

2.  FIXED  -  Pressing "P" for Point entry in the file validation 
	      editor would go into a never ending loop if there were
	      no un-validated files in a file area.

3.  FIXED  -  Pressing <CR> in the file validation editor would exit
              the validation process rather then skip to the next file

4.  CHANGE -  The file validation editor will now show the file areas
              being scanned just like other file search commands do.

5.  FIXED  -  The file area display header was off by one character.

6.  CHANGE -  In the past, the maximum number of file areas allowed
              was 2048 with compression turned on and 32767 with it
              turned off.  Renegade will now support 32767 file areas
              with compression on or off.

7.  CHANGE -  The file area listing will now display the file areas
              one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire list.
              The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from file
              area 1. Pressing <CR> will now display the next page
              (it will also restart the listing from file area 1 when
              the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will exit
              the file area display. Previously, this procedure opened
              all 3 files associated to an area (*.DIR, *.EXT & *.SCN)
              to read file area scan flag. This process sould now be
              faster since it now only opens the *.SCN file.

8.  CHANGE -  The file area change listing will now display the file
              areas one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire
              list.  The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from
              file area 1. Pressing <CR> will now display the next
              page (it will also restart the listing from file area 1
              when the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will
              exit the file area display. Entering an invalid file
              area will redisplay the current page.

9.  CHANGE -  The file area set scan listing will now display the file
              areas one page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire
              list.  The '?' will now re-list the areas starting from
              file area 1. Pressing <CR> will now display the next
              page (it will also restart the listing from file area 1
              when the last file area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will
              exit the file area display. Previously, this procedure
              opened all 3 files associated to an area (*.DIR, *.EXT
              and *.SCN) to set the area scan on or off. This process
              should now be faster since it now only opens the *.SCN
              file.

              Also, this procedure will now only set the scan on file
              areas the user has access to. The file area scan char
              has been moved to the left of the file area number vice
              between it and the file area description.

9.  FIXED  -  The resolution of a GIF file was truncated by one
              character when viewing these files using the Achive
              View Command, fixed.  Also spruced up the entire
              display.  GIF files that are missing will now be
              displayed with a blinking red "< Missing GIF >".
              GIF files that are bad will now be displayed with a
              blinking red "< Bad GIF >".  Bad or missing GIF files
              are also now added to the SysOp Log. The first line
              of the file description has been reduced to 31 chars
              to allow for the maximum possible length of the GIF
              resolution.

  1.  The File Area Editor has made modified with the following:

      A. The file area listing will now display one page at a time
         verses scrolling to the prompt.

      B. The File Area Name can not be blank or the default of

  1. The message area display header was off by one character, fixed

  2. In the past, the maximum number of message areas allowed was 
     2048 with compression turned on and 32767 with it turned off.
     Renegade will now support 32767 message areas with compression
     on or off.

     page at a time vice scrolling thru the entire list.  The '?' 
     will now re-list the message areas starting from message area 1.
     Pressing <CR> will now display the next page (it will also 
     restart the listing from message area 1 when the last message
     area is reached). Pressing 'Q' will exit the message area 
     display. Previously, this procedure opened all 3 files 
     associated to a message (*.HDR, *.DAT & *.SCN) to read the 
     message area scan flag. This process sould now be faster since
     it now only opens the *.SCN file.

     opened all 3 files associated to a message area (*.HDR, *.DAT & *.SCN)
     to set the message area scan flag on or off. This process sould now be
     faster since it now only opens the *.SCN file. Also, this procedure
     will now only set the scan on message areas the user has access to.
     The message area scan char has been moved to the left of the message
     area number vice between it and the message area description.

  6. The file area delete command will now prompt to remove the download
     and upload directory if they are not being utilized by another file
     area.

  1.  You will now be prompted to set the upload path to the download
      path when editing the download path in the File Area Editor.  The

         to scan the user file for deleted users and to set the
         *.SCN file to allow new scan for the next user to utilize
         this message area.

      K. Other changes included added some missing help data for
         certain commands and color changes.

  4.  I recommend that you access the Message Area Modify command
      once you have installed this update and toggle thru all
      message areas and make corrections to your message areas as they

1.  The file/message area compression routines have been replaced
    completely. In the previous version the following variables,
    functions and procedures were utilized:

    VAR - "FileCompArray = ARRAY[0..4095] OF SET OF 0..7"
    VAR - "MsgCompArray = ARRAY[0..4095] OF SET OF 0..7"
    Procedure - "NewCompTables:
    Function - "CompFileArea(FArea: Integer): Integer"
    Function - "CompMsgArea(MArea: Integer): Integer"
    Function - "AFBase(FArea: Integer): Integer"
    Function - "AMBase(MArea: Integer): Integer"

    The FileCompArray/MsgCompArray were previously updated by the
    NewCompTables Procedure.  The NewCompTables Procedure would
    simply read in all file/message areas and set a bit to on or off.
    The CompFileArea/CompMsgArea Functions would then display the proper
    File/Message area after counting from the first file/message area to
    the file/message area that needed to be displayed based on the user
    access and compression setting in System Configuration.  The
    AFBase/AMBase Functions were utilized to return the proper file/message
    area after counting from the first file/message area to the
    file/message area the user actually selected based on the user access
    and compression settings in System Confguration.

    As you can see from the above discription, this required alot of
    memory to maintain the FileCompArray/MsgCompArray.  It also required
    four functions for area number display and access. Not to mention
    that the real area number for both display and access had to be
    counted up to every time an area was displayed or accessed.

    The following varibales, functions and procedures are being
    utilized in this release:

    FILE - "FACT[Node].DAT" (Stored in the Node Temp Directory)
    FILE - "MACT[Node].DAT" (Stored in the Node Temp Directory)
    TYPE - "CompArrayType = ARRAY[0..1] OF INTEGER"
    VAR - "LowFileArea: Integer"
    VAR - "HighFileArea: Integer"
    VAR - "LowMsgArea: Integer"
    VAR - "HighMsgArea: Integer"
    Procedure - "NewCompTables"
    Function - "CompFileArea(FArea,ArrayNum: Integer): Integer"
    Function - "CompMsgArea(MArea,ArrayNum: Integer): Integer"

    Two new files (FACT[Node].DAT/MACT[Node].DAT have been created and
    are temporarily stored in the Node temp directory.  A record of type
    ARRAY[0..1] OF Integer is the storage method utilized for the
    individual file areas.  ARRAY 0 is utilized for storage of the
    file/message area to display and ARRAY 1 is utilized for the storage
    of the file/message area being accessed. Each record takes up 2 bytes
    of space on your harddrive and the above file will only contain
    records for the actual number of message/file areas you actually have
    available. Both of these files are created at user logon and updated
    at other appropriate times as Renegade requires and then deleted when
    the user logs off.  The NewCompTables Procedure creates and updates
    the actual file/message area for display (ARRAY 0) and the actual
    file/message area to access (ARRAY 1).  This saves on the need to
    have the FileCompArray/MsgCompArray and the need for the
    CompFileArea/CompMsgArea And AFBase/AMBAse to count everytime
    from 1 to the file/message area displayed or accessed. The
    CompFileArea/CompMsgArea Functions have been modified to access the
    record contained in the FACT[Node].DAT/MACT[Node].DAT file for the
    file/message area being display/accessed.  This eliminated the need
    for the AFBase/AMBase Functions.  CompFileArea(FArea,0) or
    CompMsgArea(FArea,0) is called to obtained the display area number
    and CompFileArea(FArea,1) or CompMsgArea(FArea,1) is called for
    the area number to access.  NewCompTables will now also return the
    LowFileArea, HighFile, LowMsgArea & HighMsgArea for trapping correct
    or incorrect file/message area user input.

    As you can see, this enhancement saved alot of memory. Display and
    access to a file/message areas should now be faster.  Adding the
    low/high File/Messae variables will also help trap user input errors.

<b style="color:#313131">Changes Since Renegade <b style="color:#EDEDEC">v1.00/DOS<b style="color:#AD2102">
===================================================================
</h1></b></b></b></b></center>
1.  ADDED  -  Two new commands for the message read menu: (See Updated
              MENUCMD.ASC File)

                RS = Show Message Poster (User Information)
                RV = Validate Message Poster (Level A-Z)

                MR CMD now needs an option to read public messages
                This was update last version but wasn't documented
                properly.

                MR = Read Messages [Options - R]

                  R - Read Public Message Areas

                Leaving the options field blank will read E-Mail.

2.  FIXED  -  When editing a message in the public areas, pressing E
              for edit and then pressing D to display header only
              displayed up to 5 lines.  If the message was posted as
              anonymous, you wouldn't see the 6th line for the real
              name to whatever name.

3.  CHANGE -  Intergrating email read menus to work in the existing
              public message read menus.  And then in so doing the
              "Back In Thread" and "Forward in Thread" now also work
              when reading private messages.  So, in the end, the
              private mail read menus will use the same public read
              menus, have the same look and feel.

4.  FIXED  -  Cleaned up the Validate user from the ReadMail command,
              this command allowed pressing a "Q" to quit, but in
              doing so, you would validate the user at whatever
              level "Q" was.  This was removed and require just that
              ENTER be pressed to avoid setting anything.

5.  CHANGE -  The move command to work to move messages from the
              public message areas to the private (not sure when the
              need might arise to do this, but maybe a flame in the
              public area and the sysop wants to move it to private
              if the receiver is a member of the bbs, rather then
              just delete it).

6.  CHANGE -  The messages are now listed before selecting a message.
              Before, all you got was a prompt that said what area
              you were in and the range of the messages to select from.
              Now, when reading all private mail or public mail, The
              messages are listed (With header) up to 18 messages per
              page.  Pressing enter takes you to the next page or 
              listing of messages.  Once you reached the end of the
              messages (by pressing ENTER) and you press it again, it
              will take you back to the first message and you can
              continue to list messages that way until you select
              one or quit.

7.  FIXED  -  The creation of VDM*.TMP files in Windows XP caused by
              Renegade are now fixed.  These files should NO LONGER
              be created because of file locking issues with Renegade.
              It took a while to fix, but ... it's windows, yaknow. ;)

8.  ADDED  -  Added a new MENUCMD Key : 

              RJ  -  Forward Public Message into Private Mail and
                     also Private E-Mail to another Private E-Mail
                     account.

              This CMD Key is for the READP Menu ONLY to FORWARD a
              public message to private e-mail.

9.  CHANGE  - The High Read Msg Pointers are no longer updated after
              a new account is created.  This was taking a very long
              time if a BBS had a large amount of messgae areas. This
              is now done the first time the user scans the msg areas.


10.  FIXED  - A bug where if the sysop shells inside a background input
              prompt (Blue for example) the screen will no longer turn
              the color of the input box in the shell.  It will clear
              the screen using a black background, lightgrey foreground.

11.  FIXED  - RG would attempt to create the entire directory (Example:
              C:\rg\dls\test).  If dls didn't exist before the "test",
              it would fail.  Now, it will create the entire directory
              (if the path is valid).  It now also reports errors to the 
              user on screen.

12.  CHANGE - You can now use a "D" to make the ULPath the same as the
              DLPath instead of typing in the entire path if they are
              the same when creating a new file area.

13.  CHANGE - New History Editor - You can now edit dates and information
              inside the HISTORY.DAT file to correct any errors that
              are noticed.   You can now view logons by BAUD RATE via the
              history editor.

14.  FIXED  - Numerous updates to all the door drop files (ongoing).

15.  CHANGE - Updated "RENEGADE.LNG" file, and new converter "RGLNG.EXE"
              which compiles the few remaining strings and removes all
              strings that were moved to differnt files and locations
              on previous versions.

16.  CHANGE - FILE_ID.DIZ File Descriptions are now expanded to 99 lines.
              All you ASCII Art Freaks should scream "Hor-ray!"

17.  FIXED  - Time Slice Routines - RG now actually detects if it is
              running under DOS, OS2 or Win32 and act accordingly.  Before
              Renegade ALWAYS thought it was under DOS and thus caused
              some slow down which was sort of addressed with the time
              slice setting in system config.  This will help even more
              now that it is hardcoded to look for this.

18. OLD/NEW - MENUCMD  *=  This allows Renegade to display long or short
              menu cmd listings.  *= with options set at 1 will display
              short menu cmds.  *= with options set at 2 will display
              long menu cmds to the screen.

19.  FIXED  - "FC" CMD KEY (Files.BBS Importer)
 
               1.  Optimized by removing a duplicate procedure.
               2.  Reports duplicate files in the Sysop.log.
               3.  Reports missing files in the Sysop.log.
               4.  The "Hatched" flag is now set for all imported files.
               5.  The user can now enter file points per file uploaded
                   when not in the waiting for caller screen (Parameter
                   switch -F).
               6.  All User/System upload statistics are checked for
                   variable overrun.
               7.  FILE_ID.DIZ will only be checked if allowed by
                   System Config setting.

20.  FIXED  - "*1" CMD KEY (Edit Files)

               1.  File name change will no longer allow renaming a
                   file if the new file names exists in the upload or
                   download path.
               2.  The Filesize limit as been increased to allow for
                   a maximum of 1.9 Gigs.  You now also have the choice
                   of updating with the actual file size or entering
                   whatever you like up to the 1.9 Gig limit.
               3.  You may now interactively edit the file description.
               4.  Changing the user name or number now reports an error
                   if the user does not exist.
               5.  Changing the upload date of the file will not allow
                   entry of a date beyond the current date.
               6.  The number of downloads has been increased to allow
                   up to 2147483647.
               7.  The modify extended description option has been
                   revamped.  If one exists, you will first be asked if
                   you would like to delete it, if one doesn't, you will
                   be asked if you would like to create one.  If you
                   decide to keep the exisiting one or created one,
                   you will be taken to the standard full screen message
                   editor, the old line by line edit mode has been
                   removed.  Existing extended descriptions will be
                   copied into the message editor for editing.  All
                   message editing option are available for line edit
                   or full screen edit mode.
               8.  The file move cmd has been revamped provides clearer
                   error message.
               9.  The User Editor option will now display messages if
                   the user doesn't meet the access requirement and
                   also default to User #1 if the current owner of the
                   file has been deleted.
              10.  All User/System upload statistics are checked for
                   variable overrun.

                                        - NOTE -

               A.  While editing the file owner name, the owner name
                   will be checked against the user name stored in
                   the user editor.  If the names do not match, the
                   file owner name will be converted to the Sysop name
                   (User #1).  The editor will assume that the orignal
                   uploader account has been deleted.

               B.  While updating the file size, if the file does not
                   exist, you will be asked if you would like to set
                   the file to offline or request status.

               C.  Use File_ID.DIZ must now be turn on in System
                   Config to be able to update or upload the Extended
                   Description (if it exists).

               D.  The internal archive viewer will now only attempt
                   to display files with the following extentions
                   (ZIP,ARC,PAK,ZOO,LZH,ARK,ARJ). IF the extention is
                   valid and the file doesn't exist, you will be
                   prompted to set the file to offline or to request
                   status.


21.  CHANGE - FILE_ID.DIZ File Descriptions are now extended to 99 lines
              of text per file.

                NOTE:

                  The way extended description were handled has
                  been revamped.  Prior to this release, every
                  extended description required 950 bytes of
                  hard drive space rather the description required
                  it or not and was limited to 19 lines.  This
                  version now allows up to 99 lines of 50 chars
                  each and will only require space for the actual
                  characters utilized plus one byte for every line
                  in the description. For example: "This is a great
                  file" would only require 20 + 1 byte or 21 bytes
                  of harddrive space verses the old minimum of
                  950 bytes.


22.  ADDED  - "OB" CMD KEY (User Statistics)

                1.  Renegade now has built in User Top 10 Statistics.
                    I recommend that a new menu be created for these
                    cmds.  Menu options are listed below along with
                    the title of the action performed.

                2.  Adding ;## will not allow that specific user to
                    be included in the stats file.  Example:  A;1
                    would not all User #1 to be posted in the current
                    stats screen.

                          Option     Top 10 Result

                             A         High Time Users
                             B         File Kbyte Uploaders
                             C         File Kbyte Downloaders
                             D         Private Message Senders
                             E         Public Message Posters
                             F         SysOp Feedback Senders
                             G         All Time Callers
                             H         File Uploaders
                             I         File Downloaders
                             J         File Points
                             K         Upload/Download Ratios
                             L         Post/Call Ratios
                             M         Top Download Files


23.  ADDED  - "L7" CMD KEY (File Archive View Tagging)

              Used on FILEP menu to allow file tagging when
              viewing internal archives.  Sames some time from
              having to type out the full filename. ;)

24.  CHANGE - Added 2 60 character lines to voting editor.  This
              replaces the 1 line of 65 characters.  Now you have
              2 lines to ramble on about for your voting pleasure.

25.  CHANGE - Moved time bank options from the timebank menu to
              System Config, Option E, Cmds X, Y, and Z.  This
              involved Max Time, Max Withdrawl, Max Deposit.

              No longer do you have to list these options in the
              options field of each command as they are now hard
              coded into Renegade.

26.  FIXED  - The Color Codes of the SYSOP.LOG file, no longer
              bleed from line to line.  Now each line will have
              it's own apporiate color(s), if color for logfile
              is turned on in System Config.

27.  ADDED  - Option to Messagae Base Editor to Renumber the
              QWK Index.  This is inplace to ensure each base
              has it's own IDX # and there are no duplicates.
              This should really only be used if you are
              having issues with QWK, or if you don't do a
              lot of QWK, to renumber the QWK # to match the
              base position number in the editor.

28.  ADDED  - ALT-S while a user is online will now enter into a
              split screen chat mode session.  ALT-C still works
              the same as before in a line by line text mode
              chat session.

              ALT-S was previously (Turn SysOp Status Bar ON/OFF),
              this cmd has moved to ALT-A.

29.  CHANGE - Made RGLNG to compile all strings in one easy swoop.
              RENEGADE.LNG needs renamed to RGLNG.TXT for this to
              work tho.



 ---------------------- READ BELOW FOR CHANGES!!! -------------------------

Validation System Changes:

  1.  In order to save memory, the validation records were moved from
      the RENEGADE.DAT file to the new VALIDATE.DAT file. These records
      were previously stored as an array of 1 to 26 records taking up
      about 3484 bytes of memory when loaded. This array also limited
      the number of available validation records to a maximum of 26.

  2.  Removing the validation records from the array stored in memory
      also allowed for increasing the maximum allowed validation records
      from 26 to 94. Of course, this changed the range of validation keys
      from A-Z to !-~.

  3.  Since the old new user validation key was logically the letter "A"
      (Or first character in the set).  The '!' is now the first character
      in the set and became the new user validation key.  The code has been
      internally modified to accept this key as such.  So, if you are using
      the letter "A" in your scripts or for your auto-validation command,
      please change it to the "!".

  4.  The VALIDATE.DAT file is checked during boot-up for existance and
      to ensure that it contains at least the new user validation record.
      Available validation keys are also stored in memory for later use
      in the validation process.

Validation Editor:

  1.  The Validation Editor has been completely re-written adding a record
      delete, insert and position function. The modify option has also been
      extensively modified.

  2.  The deletion function will not allow removal of the new user
      validation record. It will also not allow you to remove a validation
      key that is still attached as an expire to key for any users.  You
      must first delete the expire to key from all users prior to deleting
      the effected key from the validation editor. Deleting a key also
      removes it from memory and global use.

  3.  The insert function will allow adding any one of the possible 94
      validation keys if it does not already exist. Inserting a key adds
      it to memory and is also available for global use.

  4.  Changes to the modify option:

      A.  Added a header to the records list display.
      B.  Added the Validation key to the record.  This key can not be
          modified.
      C.  The validation key description can not be modified for the
          new user validation key.
      D.  Added a free form field that will be sent to the user as a
          short message at logon.  This field should be utilized to inform
          the user of the type of validation they received.
      E.  The SL can no longer be lower then the SL stored in the New User
          Record of the USERS.DAT file (Record 0).
      F.  The DSL can no longer be lower then the DSL stored in the New
          User Record of the USERS.DAT file (Record 0).
      G.  Combined the AR modification and AR upgrade option into one cmd.
      H.  Combined the AC modification and AC upgrade option into one cmd.
      I.  Added a field for file point entry (Not implimented).
      J.  Increased the allowable credits from 65535 to 2147483647.
      K.  Added menu display for the start menu option.
      L.  Combined the expiration days/expire to option in one command.
          Before, you could actually set one and not other.  Expiration
          days without an expire to key wouldn't do anything more then
          having an expire to key without expiration days. Setting a null
          value for one forces they other to a null value as well. You can
          not modify these fields for the new user validation record.  Why
          would you want to expire someone below your lowest value. Also,
          you will only be able to attach keys that actually exists. This
          Expire To key can not be the same as the validation key
          associated to the record you are currently modifying.

  5.  The position command works the same as it would in any other editor
      within renegade.

User Editor:

  1.  Combined the expiration days/expire to option in one command.
      Before, you could actually set one and not other.  Expiration
      days without an expire to key wouldn't do anything more then
      having an expire to key without expiration days. Setting a null
      value for one forces they other to a null value as well. Also,
      you will only be able to attach keys that actually exists.

      NOTE: You must set both the expiration date and expire to key to
            null for every user it's attached to should you ever want to
            delete a validation key.

Auto-Validation Command:

  1.  The menu option is checked for proper syntex <password;Level>.
  2.  The level is checked to ensure it actually exists or logs an error.
  3.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
  4.  This command will exit and log an error if the "Expire To Level"
      does not exists.
  5.  This command will exit and log an error if a user attempts to
      validate themselves at the same access level (Checks SL/DSL/AR/AC).
  6.  This command will exit and log an error if a user attempts to
      validate themselves at a lower access level (Checks SL/DSL).
  7.  The password length is now set to a maximum of 20 characters.
  8.  Entry of the password is now masked.
  9.  Incorrect password entry exits and logs and error.
  10. If it exists, the file "AUTOVAL" is displayed upon sucessfull
      validation. Otherwise, the user message stored in the validation
      level is displayed.
  11. The sysop window message and sysop log entry has been changed to
      display either "himself" or "herself" (Depending on the user gender)
      and the auto-validation level.

Validation (Prompted):

  1.  The validation level selection prompt will only except entry of an
      existing level in the validation editor.
  2.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
  3.  This command will display a message if the "Expire To Level" does
      not exists.
  4.  This command will display a message to the user if an attempt is made
      to validate a user at the same access level (Checks SL/DSL/AR/AC).
  5.  This command will now display both the old a new settings when a
      validation key is selected and offer the user an option to continue
      with validation using the current level or select another level.
  6.  The user is now sent the short message stored in the validation level.

Validation (Internel):

  1.  The level is checked to ensure it actually exists or exits and logs
      an error.
  2.  The command will exit and log an error if the expiration days and
      expire to fields are not both activated or nulled.
  3.  The "Expire To" level is checked to ensure it actually exists or the
      option exits and logs an error.


Conference System Changes:

  1.  In order to save memory, the conference records were converted
      from loading as an array of records to load as a single record.
      These records were previously stored as an array of 1 to 27
      records taking up about 1674 bytes of memory when loaded.

  2.  The CONFRENC.DAT file is checked during boot-up for existance and
      to ensure that it contains at least the general conference record.
      Available conference keys are also stored in memory for later use
      in the conference system process.

Conference Editor:

  1.  The Conference Editor has been completely re-written adding a record
      position function.

  2.  The deletion function will not allow removal of the general
      conference record. Deleting a conference will also convert the
      last conference a user was in to the general conference if it was
      the same conference being deleted. Deleting a key also removes it
      from memory and global use.

  3.  The insert function will allow adding any one of the possible 27
      conference records if it does not already exist. Inserting a key
      adds it to memory and is also available for global use.

  4.  Changes to the modify option:

      A.  Added the conference key to the record.  This key can not be
          modified.
      C.  The conference description can not be modified for the
          general conference.

  5.  The position command works the same as it would in any other editor
      within renegade.

Change Conference Command:

  1.  Will now generate an error if the menu option is not an existing
      conference or '?'.


The following features have been added to RG:

  1.  Added an option to toggle all AR flags "*".
  2.  Added a clear fields function. This feature can be accessed by pressing 
"$" in the user editor.  Any fields that are cleared will be re-asked of the 
user the next time they logon.  Handy for questionable entries in the user 
record.

Internal Message Editor Changes:

   1.  The total line counter was off by one, fixed.

   2.  The line editor was originally split into two separate sub menus.
       The first menu allowed for general adding of text and editing
       along with the importing of text files, attaching files, etc.
       If you wanted to edit a line, you had to exit to the second menu.
       This second menu also contained some commands that were duplicative
       from of first menu.  Now, these two menus have been combined
       into one menu.  All duplicative code has been removed.

   3.  A number of new user error messages have been added utilizing the
       color code  or Red.

   4.  Command changes:

       Abort -  Will now display an error message if the message can not
                be aborted.

       Clear -  Will now display an error message if the message is empty.

       Delete - Will now display an error message if the message is empty.
                This command will also display the deleted line and give
                you an option to continue or not with it's deletion.

       File Attach - Will now display an error message if the user does
                     not have file attach access.  The user is also
                     prompted as to rather they wish to proceed with
                     the file attachment or not.

       Insert - Will now display an error message if the message is empty
                and when the user has reached the maximum lines allowed.
                The user will be prompted with the line number to insert
                and asked if they want to proceed with the line insertion.

       List   - Will now display an error message if the message is
                empty.  Will now ask the user if they want to list the
                entire message or allow the user to enter a starting
                line number. The listing "Pause" has been changed to
                the "Allow Continue" pause.

       Dsiable MCI - Will now display an error message if the user does
                     not meet the access requirements.

       Replace String - Will now display an error message if the message
                        is empty.  The user is prompted to continue or
                        not with the string replacemnt after editing.

       Quote - Will display an error message if the user is not
               replying to a message.  Will also display an error
               message when the maximum lines are reached. Corrected
               the line number display (it would only justify up to
               2 char positions, will now adjust for 3).

       Delete Last Line - Will now display an error message if the
                          message is empty.  Will prompt the user to
                          continue or not with the last line deletion.

       Save -  Will now delete any empty lines at the end of the message.
               Ever notice an empty saved message.  This was due to the
               fact that a user could just hit the space bar to save one
               line of the message.  Now, this line is checked for all
               spaces and not saved.  An error message is sent to a user
               that can not abort the message if the message contains no
               text.  A message can not be saved that contains no text
               (Or at least I hope I thought of everything).

       Title - An error message is sent to the user if they can not change
               the title.  This normally applies to non-abortable
               messages.

       Upload - An error message is sent to the user if they have reached
                the maximum line limit.

       Replace Line - An error message is sent to the user if the message
                      is empty.  The user is prompted to continue with
                      the line replacement or not.

       <CR> -  Will allow you to continue adding lines to the message or
               will display the PRHELP.ASC file after every 5 keypresses
               when the maximum lines have been reached.

       ? - Displays the new PRHELP.ASC file.

   5.  If the maximum lines have not be reached, pressing the enter key
       five times will display the following messages:

       "Enter "/?" on a blank line for help."

       The 5 proceeding blank lines will also be removed.  This is helpful
       for new users.

   6.  Discovered a maximum character per line difference between the
       Full Screen Editor and the Line Editor.  This error was actually
       with the char count in the Line Editor and has been corrected.


Additional Message Editor Changes:

  1.  Non-abortable message changes (New User, etc):

      A. File attachment not allowed - Attaching a file
         would change the original subject of the message.

      B. Title change not allowed - The original receiver and
         subject should remain the same.

         Note:  The user can not abort or save a message that
                contains no text.

  2.  File attachment changes:

      A.  In previous releases, a user with file attachment access
          was not warned if they tried to attach a file when a file
          was already attached. However, this basically allowed the
          user to swap out the file should they attach an incorrect
          file.  In this release, if a file is already attached, the
          attached file will be displayed and the user will be prompted
          to replace the file.  I took this a step further, a user may
          also want to remove the attached file all together.  Presently,
          there is no option for this without aborting the message.
          Therefore, an option has been added for removing the attached
          file.  In this case, the user is also prompted to change the
          message subject.  If the subject contains no text, removing
          the attached file is aborted.

  3.  Error messages:

      A.  I did not feel there was adequate messages to the user as to
          certain editor options.  So, this area has been greatly
          expanded.  For example: Pressing "C" to clear a message
          when the message contains no text, now informs the user of
          this situation rather then nothing at all.

  4.  Empty messages:

      A.  In an effort to reduce the possibilty of an empty message being
          saved, the following apply:

          1.  All null lines at the end of a message are deleted.
          2.  All lines at the end of a message containing nothing
              but spaces are deleted.

          NOTE:  Lines are reviewed in reverse order up to the first
                 line containing text. The user will not be able to
                 save the message unless it contains some kind of
                 text.

  5.  Title change:

      A.  In certain cases, changing the title would actually remove
          the subject of the message.  I believe this error has now
          been corrected.

1.  File Downloads -

    A.  If an actual protocol (Like ZModem) was the first protocol
        (or record zero), the downloaded file would not have the UL/DL
        ratio checked.  This was do to the ratio being set to look for
        protocol records from [1..200].  Also, the maximum protocols
        allowed at present is 120.  The above should have been [0..120]
        to be correct.

    B.  For the ratio check, the FindFirst procedure would look for the
        file on the harddrive even if the ratio didn't need to be checked.
        This procedure was moved to only get the filesize if the ratio
        needs to be checked.  

        NOTE:  The FindFirst procedure would allow searching of any type
        of file on the hardrive.  This has been changed to not allow
        searching of Directory, VolumnID, Hidden & SysFiles.

    C.  In the present version, duplicate files could be added to the
        batch download queue.  This alpha release no longer allows
        duplicate files in the queue.

    D.  Downloading any file locally would place an entry in
        the sysop.log that the DL was successfull, fixed.

    E.  Adding a file to the batch DL queue will no loner indicate in the
        sysop.log that the file was downloaded successfully.  Now, it
        will either indicate that the file was added to the batch queue or
        that an unlisted file was added to the batch queue.  Adding a file
        to the queue doesn't complete the DL.

    F.  The ASCII download of a file has been modified.  The allow
        continue prompt and a pause after the DL has been added.


File download buf fixes/enhancements:

  1.  The Star procedure would carry the last color to the next
      line, fixed.

  2.  Downloading a file locally would increment various dl statistics,
      fixed.

  3.  Downloading an unlisted file locally will now prompt the sysop
      or user for a path to copy the file to (Like a regular download
      currently does).

  4.  The copy command for local downloads, local unlisted downloads
      and copy from CDRom now gives more detail as to the status of
      the copy both to the user and sysop.log.

  5.  Viewing a text file will now indicate that it was viewed vice
      downloaded both to the user and sysop.log.

  6.  Attemtping to view a text file that is missing will no longer
      increment the DL statistics.

  7.  The system should no longer allow downloading or uploading of
      batch files locally.  It should also no longer increment DL/UL
      statistics for batch transfers.

  8.  The user record was saved everytime a file was selected for
      download even if the download was aborted or not completed,
      fixed.

  9.  There was an error in the checking of DL codes against the
      returncode when downloading files.  The DL codes in the
      protocol record are currently strings.  This string was being
      converted to a numeric value internally even if it were empty.
      The string to numeric conversion routine would interpret this
      empty string as a value of zero.  Since the value for success
      was set to a zero also, the system would assume a successful
      result.  Now, if the DLCode is a null string, it is not compared
      against the return code.  You may now have to input a zero into
      one of the DLCodes in the protocol record for a proper comparison.
      This also applies to the ULCodes in the protocol record.

 10.  Removed an extra file area initialization procedure in the DLX
      procedure.


Renegade enhancements/bug fix's:

  1.  Removed a duplicate procedure for crediting the uploader for a
      file that was downloaded by another user.

  2.  During a batch download, if no DL/Temp log was specified in the
      protocol editor, the uploader did not receive credit for the
      download. Other system/user statistics were updated though,
      fixed.

  3.  The above credit procedure never worked anyway due to some
      calculation errors in the code, fixed.

  4.  A message telling the user to enjoy the file was only displayed
      if the user was charged file points, fixed.

  5.  Messages to the user and the sysop.log provide additonal
      information about the Single Download.


Renegade BBS Enhancements/Bug Fix's:

  1.  Before the posting of a message or uploading of a file
      (Batch/Single), the available drive space was checked to
      ensure adequate space exists according to the system setup.
      This section of the code was duplicated in 3 places.  I converted
      this section to a function reducing numerous lines of code and
      extra variabes whenever it was utilized in the code.

  2.  The copy/move procedures are now combined into one function.
      Variables for failure, no space and success were required
      external to the procedures everytime they were called. Various
      messages to the user/sysop.log were also reported external
      to these procedures.  I also noticed that the move procedure
      called the copy procedure if renaming a file was not successfull.
      Now, no variables are required externally for the function and
      messages to the user/sysop.log are handled internally within
      the copy/move function.

  3.  I noticed that a section of the code for executing file
      transfer's was duplicated in 4 places.  This has been moved to
      a single procedure reducing numerous lines of code and
      variables.

  4.  I noticed that a section of the code for checking the return
      code on file transfer's was duplicated in 3 places.  This has
      been moved to a single procedure reducing numerous lines of code
      and variables.

  5.  The FILES.BBS selected for download during a batch transfer by
      the user now contains this starting entry:

       "(BBS Name) Batch Download File Listing"

      Previously, unlisted files were not written to the above list.
      Now, they are with "[No Description Available]" as the description.
      Also, files in the batch download queue with a bad path download
      path will have "[Bad Download Path]" as the description. These
      additions help account for files selected for Batch DL by the
      user.

  6.  The max dos character field in the protocol editor has now been
      limited to 127 characters (Was 255).  I always thought it was 128,
      however I couldn't type in any more then 127 characters on the
      command line in DOS. Please feel free to check this out for
      yoursele and change you editor accordingly.

  7.  Removed spaces from the file name written to the protocol file
      list for batch downloads.

  8.  The procedure that reads the success/failure codes and file name
      from the protocol temp log has been modified.  The starting
      position of the code and file name is specified in the protocol
      editor.  Assumming you set this up correctly, the success/failure
      code and the filename are copied to temporary strings. The success
      code is compared against the returncode from dos for single
      download/upload protocols or the DLCode specified in the protocol
      editor for batch downloads and the temp log.  This code is not
      utilized for batch uploads, the file is simply checked for existance.
      The temporary file name is compared against the batch queue for
      existance.  Since different protocol programs like dsz, etc utilize
      different log formats, it's impossible to tell the actual length of
      the success code or filename read from the temp log.  RG would simply
      read each string from the starting position and then chop off any
      trailing spaces and compared them as per above.  However, with ZM
      protocol, the file name ends with ",".  Therefore, I changed the
      comparison to look for the success code/filename to a String POS
      procedure rather then String = String.  In local tests (Both Single
      and Batch) it seemed to work without issue, we will see? The way it
      was handled before did not work with ZM protocol.  Hopefully, this
      solves it for all others (assuming you set things up correctly in the
      protocol editor.

      Here's a few things I learned about protocols while editing the
      RG code:

        1.  If you set the option "Codes mean" in the protocol editor
            to "Transfer Successfull", you must specify a return dlcode
            and or ulcode for single protocols of zero.  Zero is hard
            coded into the procedure that executes the protocol.  A
            return code of zero from DOS indicates a successfull result.
            Of course, you could also reverse the above and specify
            "Codes mean" as "Transfer Failed" and specify all possible
            DLCodes/ULCodes as something other then zero.

        2.  If you do not specify a temp log for batch downloads, no
            error checking occurs within RG.  RG assumes the files were
            downloaded and increments statistics, etc.  RG does not create
            the temp log, you must add it to the DL/UL command line. You
            must also specify the proper file name and status starting
            positions within the log for RG to locate them.  Please
            read the protocol document for a description of the log
            entries and then count out the status & filename positions
            for the protocol editor.

            Here's what you need for the ZM protocol:

              1. Specify a Temp Log.
              2. Add -lz%L to the DL/UL Command Line to create a ZM
                 style log.
              3. Set "Codes mean" to "Transfer Successfull".
              4. Set DL/UL Code 1 as Z, Set DL/UL Code 2 as z.
              5. Set "File name" to 22.
              6. Set "Status" to 1.

              OR

              1. Specify a Temp Log.
              2. Add -ld%L to the DL/UL Command Line to create a DSZ
                 style log.
              3. Set "Codes mean" to "Transfer Successfull".
              4. Set DL/UL Code 1 as Z, Set DL/UL Code 2 as z.
              5. Set "File name" to 51.
              6. Set "Status" to 1.

        3.  The temp log is deleted by RG automatically, if you need
            or want a permanent log please specify a UL or DL Log.

            NOTE:  I realize some of you may know all there is to know
            about protocols and how they are handled by RG.  However,
            some do not.  Remember, if you do not specify all the above,
            your files will be transferred without error checking and
            statistics will not be updated.  Of course, you could forgo
            the above setup and RG will assume all files tranferred
            successfully.

        4.  Using the above setup may or may not work with currently
            released versions of RG or all external protocol programs.

Ok, one minor change, only use the lower case 'z' for the batch dlcode, not 
the upper case "Z".  The upper case 'Z" is for batch uploads and RG doesn't 
look at the ULCode for batch transfers.  Again, use the lower case 'Z" only 
for the batch dlcode.


Renegade Bug Fix's/Enhancements:

  1.  Batch uploaded files would normally be moved to the file area
      selected by the user.  However, if the system was setup
      to utilize *.DIZ files and the uploaded file contained a *.DIZ,
      the file was moved to the current file area regardless of the
      area selected by the user, fixed!

  2.  Added a sysop.log entry to indicate that start and end of scanning
      the protocol temp log for downloaded files.  These entries were
      also added for the start and end scanning of the BATCHDL.DAT if the
      temp log is not being utilized.

  3.  If the protocol temp log is being utilized, an entry was made to
      the sysop.log that the batch download failed.  This has been
      changed to indicate that the file or return code wasn't found.

      Example SysOp.Log For Batch Downloaded Files:

      (If protocol temp log is utilized).

      Start scan of "BATCH6.LOG" for batch downloaded files.
      File not found: TEST.EXE
      Return code not found: FILELIST.EXE
      Batch downloaded: PKZIP.EXE
      End scan of "BATCH6.LOG" for batch downloaded files.

      NOTE:  The above changes should assist in locating errors
      related to inproper protocol file name and status position
      configuration.

      (If protocol temp log is not utilized).

      Start scan of "BATCHDL.DAT" for batch downloaded files.
      Batch Downloaded: TEST.EXE
      Batch downloaded: FILELIST.EXE
      Batch downloaded: PKZIP.EXE
      End scan of "BATCHDL.DAT" for batch downloaded files.

  4.  If the user does not have enough time left online to complete
      a batch download they will be taken to the Batch DL Edit
      options (Clear, List & Remove).

  5.  If the filesize of an uploaded file were zero, the file would be
      awarded a file point, fixed (Example: OffLine Files).

  6.  If a file does not exist in the upload path during a local upload
      the user is prompted to make an offline entry. Previously a message
      was displayed before this question indicating that the file did
      not exist in the file directory.  This has been changed to indicate
      that the file does not exist in the upload path.  Also, there
      was no previous warning to the user that the file already exist in
      the file listing.  A message has now been added indicating that the
      file exists in the file listing. (Note: A duplicate entry will be
      added to the *.DIR file if the user selects "YES");

  7.  If a %F is utilized to pass the file name to DOS, it is checked to
      ensure it doesn't exceed the maximum DOS char length.  Only files
      up to this point are passed to DOS for processing, anything past
      this point in the Batch queue is not.  I added a sysop log entry
      for the first file in the queue that exceeds this length.  I did
      noticed that this process is only utilized for batch download
      transfers and may be required for the other transfer options.

  8.  Information about the name, size and download time are now
      displayed to the user about the Batch Download File Listing.  The
      total new download time is also displayed to the user.

  9.  The filesize was previously stored in the *.DIR file in 128 Byte
      blocks.  There was also a field used to store the remainder or
      bytes left over between 0-127.  This remainder was not fully
      implemented throughout the code to account for the total filesize.
      This impacted CPS rates and info displayed to the user about the real
      filesize and estimated download time.  I took a real hard look at
      this storage method and remembered that at one time, WWIV used this
      storage method for internal protocols.  Up till now, alot of extra
      code was required to convert the filesize to this dual storage
      method and alot was required to convert it back.  I saw no reason
      to continue this method.  Now, the filesize of a file contained
      in the *.DIR is stored as the actual filesize (LongInt Value).  All
      code related to this back and forth convertion has been removed.
      I provided an extra informational line for the 128/1024 block size
      that will be displayed when a file is selected for download.

  10. The date was stored in the *.DIR file as both a longint value in
      seconds and the number of days since originally uploaded.  Once
      again, this required alot of extra code to convert back and forth
      and was only utilized in 2 places.  So, the number of days' since
      uploaded has been removed and is now calculated internally as
      needed.

Renegade Updates/Enhancements:

  1.  ZM protocol will default to "/" vice "\" as directory path
      separators for *.log entries.  There is an option to convert
      this on the command line, however some sysops don't always read
      the documentation.  So, I added an internal conversion routine to
      look for this separator and automatically convert it.

  2.  The message after adding a file to the batch download queue will now
      display the cumulative total of file points along with the number of
      files and download time.

  3.  During a file download, the ratio of Uploads to Downloads is
      checked.  Although the ratio check of the total K bytes included
      the current file being downloaded, the ratio check of the total
      files did not include the current file being downloaded, fixed.


Renegade Updates/Enhancements:

  1. A file can no longer be copied onto itself or moved to the same
     directory it currently resides in.

  2. In local mode, you must have CoSysOp access to move or copy an
     attached file or file selected for download.

  3. I noticed that download and upload statistics were displayed for
     batch transfers even if "Log-off after file transfer was selected",
     but not for single download or upload transfers, fixed.

  4. Some items selected for download went thru the DLX procedure and
     some went directly to the send procedure.  Alot of extra code and
     variables were required for the send procedures everytime it was
     called.  Now, all download requests go thru the DLX procedure and
     then to the send procedure.  With this change, file downloading
     can be tracked for all downloads thru the same statistcal process.
     This includes, File attach, QWK, Unlisted and user archive.

  5. All regular downloads were checked to ensure the user met all
     security requirements, ratio, etc prior to the download.  However,
     if a user was exempt from certain ratio checks, the user was
     charged anyway for the download unless the file area was marked
     as No-Ratio.  This applied to users flagged as No UL/DL Ratio in
     the User Record, No UL/DL Ratio in the System record, etc.

  6. You will now be asked if the file exists on a CDROM for unlisted
     downloads.  This will alow for faster file transfers since the
     file is copied from the CDRom to the Temp Node Directory for
     download.

  7. The default file name for extracting text from a message has been
     changed from "MSG.TXT" to MSG<Node>.TXT.  Of course, you still
     have the option of changing this to whatever you like at the
     prompt.

  8. For Offline mail transfers, the bbs will no longer attempt to copy
     the WELCOME, NEWS or GOODBYE file if they path to the file is
     blank.


Renegade updates/enhancements:

  1. Fixed a bug related to the length of the dlcode/ulcode in the
     protocol editor.  The maximum length of this string is 6 chars.

  2. No process was in place to prevent ul/dl statistical variable
     overrun, fixed.

  3. The color from the auto-logoff countdown procedure carried the
     last color to the next line, fixed.  This would only be noticed
     if the user escaped or cancelled the auto-logoff.

  5. The color from the scaninput procedure carried the last color to
     the next line, fixed. I noticed this with the batch download file
     remove command.

  6. Since files added to the batch downloaded queue are listed as such
     in the sysop.log, it only made since to list files removed from
     the batch download queue in the sysop.log as well. An entry to
     the sysop.log is also made when the batch download queue is
     cleared.

  8. The uploader name/date and the message to the user to continue a
     resume file did not redisplay the file name when wrapped to the
     next page while utlizing the file list command, fixed.

  9. I think I finally have some issues corrected with the file
     listing display.  Every now and then an extra file area
     header would display when not needed.  Also, sometimes the line
     counter would be off by one or two lines and push the file area
     header up one or two lines or completely off the screen.  I also
     noticed a line feed missing when the listing was aborted or
     exited normally.


Renegade bug fix's/enhancements:

  1.  Due to space limitations, the file listing display will utilize
      bytes or kbytes depending on the file point settings in the
      system configuration. To be consistant, this process is now
      also being utilized for the file size displayed when a file is
      selected for download.

  2.  When a file is selected for viewing, the user will be cautioned
      that the file is not checked to ensure it is an ascii text file
      and then asked if they would like to continue.

  3.  The file listing download and add batch prompt has been cleaned
      up.  It would formally allow input of '-' by itself or the '-'
      proceeding or following a file number and alpha characters. The
      input of an invalid file number will now display a message to the
      user.

  4.  Adding a file to the batch queue from the file listing display
      will now display all the file information related to that file.
      It will also now properly check the file to ensure it is ok to
      download and send it thru the proper ratio checks.  I have to
      admit that this was an oversite on my part when I added the
      ability to select a file by number.  Basically it now goes
      directly thru the DLX procedure vice being added directly to
      the batch download queue.


File download bug fixes/enhancements:

  1.  I fixed an issue with certain commands accessed from the
      file listing menu.  For example, the file edit command would
      allow you to edit whatever file you selected, but when you
      returned to the file list, it wouldn't return you to the
      proper record.  This appears to have been a long standing
      issue and I may have additional commands to correct that might
      be added to this menu.

  2.  I added a new command to the file listing menu.  This command
      allows you to flag a file to edit like the batch flag or flag
      download.  The command is "L8".  You can select by number or
      range and go back and forth thru the range like you could if
      you were using the regular file edit command.  You must have
      File Sysop access to utilize this command.

</h1></b></b></b></b></center>
 1.  FIXED  - The Auto Time Display Flag (A) in the Menu Editor
               would not toggle on or off, this has been corrected.
               The Menu List Number and Menu Number was right
               justified to make for a better looking display and
               "(C)ommand editor" was added to the Prompt.

  2. CHANGE  - In preparation for converting the Email System over
               to have the same look and feel of the message system,
               the following commands were changed in the Out Going
               Mail command:

               (P)revious was changed to (-)Previous
               (R)e-read was changed to (A)gain

  3.  FIXED  - The File Editor would give the option to delete
               all data files associated to an area when that
               area was deleted.  The problem was that it would only
               delete the *.DIR file and not the *.EXT or *.SCN files.
               The File Editor would also give the option of copying
               the data files over to the new directory when the "I"
               option was toggled in the File Area Flags.  The problem
               was that it would only copy the *.DIR file and not the
               *.EXT or *.SCN files, these have both been fixed.

  4. CHANGE  - All extended file descriptions were previously saved to
               one file (EXTENDED.DAT).  This has been changed so that
               all file areas have their own individual *.EXT file.
               Should the EXTENDED.DAT file ever get corrupted, you could
               have possibly lost all extended description for your entire
               file area.  This will also help make it easier to add
               code for actually deleting the extended description for
               any files that you delete from a file area. Previously
               extended file descriptions were not actually deleted, only
               blocked out from access taking up hard drive space. That's
               969 bytes for every file!

  5.  FIXED  - The file move command still allowed moving a file to file
               area 0, which doesn't exists, fixed.

  6.  ADDED  - Internal FILES.BBS importer.  New Menu CMD Key "FC" allows
               the scanning of all file areas configured inside of
               Renegade to import descriptions from anything that lists
               a FILES.BBS such as shareware CDs.  Also, instead of
               loading Renegade, load Renegade via cmd line -F to start
               the FILES.BBS importer without loading Renegade itself.

  7. FIXED   - All Menu Editor related bugs to adding/removing menus.

  8. ADDED   - Option to allow the use of multiple "quote headers".
               With this option, you will be able to change the
               quote header on each base.  This will default to what
               ever is in the RENEGADE.LNG file.

  9. ADDED   - Option to allow the use of multiple "read prompt" menus
               per message area.  This will allow the SysOp to make
               seperate menu cmds for each base if need be.  This is
               mainly used if you want seperate conferences for
               certain bases or certain access and cmds for certain
               message areas.

 10. ADDED   - Option to allow the posting of a text file PER message
               area each time a user posts.  Yes, we know this will
               get old, but it will allow say a posting of "rules" to
               be displayed to the user at each posting thus washing
               your hands of a matter when the user says he has no
               idea he wasn't allowed to do something in a certain
               message area.

 11. CHANGE  - Extended the length of the message posts.  (ie:
               email/public/private) to 500 lines max.  The current
               default was set to 200, but you were getting no more
               than 50-60 depending on the amount of memory that was
               installed into the computer.

 12. UPDATE  - Removed most system menus to external string files.
               Also added a compiler for these new string files.
               This will allow the use of the software in any
               language and allow faster access to the menus than
               they were before.  We will shortly be pulling all
               strings and messages from within the code and
               making them external.

 13. ADDED   - New CMD Keys QQ - Random Quote Generator Display.
               Compile your quote text file with RGQUOTE and
               make a menu cmd and place the QUOTE file name
               in the options field to display the quotes one at
               a time.

 14. ADDED   - Toggle under system config to turn the above
               feature ON or OFF at logon.  This works much like
               the AutoMessage feature works.  Must have LGNQUOTE
               compiled and in the DATA directory for this option
               to work.  LGNQUOTE is compiled with RGQUOTE.EXE.

 15. ADDED   - Option in Message Base to turn ON or OFF tagline
               addition to the message you have just posted.  For
               this option to work TAGLINE.TXT must reside in the
               DATA directory and be compiled with TAGLINE.EXE.

 16. ADDED   - Auto Random quoting at the end of messages.  E-Mail
               Local, and Echo Message areas will automatically
               have a quote added at the bottom of the message.
               This can be toggled ON/OFF on each message base
               and now EMAIL.

 17. ADDED   - The E-Mail Subsystem has been added to the Message
               base editor.  This will be record 0, which you can
               edit certain features and strings.

 18. ADDED   - Option to add to quote file at logon via system
               config toggle.  This will create a file called
               *.NEW (Taking on the firstname of whichever
               quotefile a quote was added to.) and then you
               can then copy new quotes over into the correct
               file and recompile it.  Please note, you MUST
               erase this file when you are done with it or it
               will continue to append to the end of the file
               and take up space.

 18. ADDED   - Option to add a quote to E-Mail or a Message is
               now asked after the message is saved.  This can
               be toggled ON/OFF in the message base editor.

 19. FIXED   - Standardize the SysOp.Log File - The log file
               was cutting off a user if they logged on around
               midnight of that night.  They were either tossed
               into the night before or the current one.  This
               has no been corrected to be sorted into the
               correct file.

  1.  FIXED  - /S command in teleconference not displaying the
               correct information (or any actually).  This has
               now been corrected.  Basically fixed all commands
               in the teleconference to work properly.  Removed
               all 0-, 5-, 1- and such debugging code as well.

  2.  FIXED  - Total Free Space Showing on the WFC Screen is now
               displaying correctly up to 999.9 megs.

  3.  CHANGE - The Menu system is now non-existant as text files.
               They have been converted over to DATA files with
               a new MENU EDITOR added into Renegade.  This frees
               up from internal memory and speeds things up a bit.

  4.  ADDED  - Added option under S. System Config, A. Main BBS Config,
               K. System Menus.  This is where it will tell Renegade
               which are the main system menus and that are not allowed
               to be deleted.  This also plays into the effect of
               all the numbered menus now instead of names.  The
               included Menu Converter will take care of this and
               any/all menus you have.

  5.  FIXED  - Annonying "Cannot Load NODEx.DAT file" error.

  6.  UPDATE - File/Message/Protocol/Event Editors to more closely
               reflect the look and feel of the menu editor.  Thus,
               giving things a more universal look and feel.

  7.  FIXED  - The option to edit the arctype in the File Menu.

  8.  FIXED  - The Shell to DOS in the WFC was a "J" (Not listed) and
               renamed it to "D" to conform with the WFC Screen.

  9.  FIXED  - The option for using a "U" to determine if you were
               doing anything with batch upload command or batch
               download commands compared against a capital "U", the
               problem was that the file editor allows lower case
               entry of this "U", added and allcaps to the menu were
               it compared the two.  Didn't change the file editor
               to still allow lower case for the options.

 10. REMOVE  - The option to PRINT SysOp Log files.  This command
               only printed to the LPT port.  Really, who has a
               LPT Printer anymore?  Command removed.

 11. CHANGE  - Removed all extra spacing after internal prompts
               left.   ie: before "Menu Prompt :"  now "Menu Prompt:"

 12. CHANGE  - 200 Menu commands are now allowed per each menu
               set.  This was defaulted to 100.  200 Should be more
               than enough for any users.  If you need more, you
               need a life! ;)

 13.  FIXED  - Batch Files: Any files left in the Batch Queue after
               logoff would not be stored for download after the
               next logon to the BBS.

 14.  CHANGE - Overlays are revamped and the param switch -D for 
               disabling EMX/XMS and -O for setting the OvrExtraSize
               (Default 64K).  The -D switch was added incase for
               some odd reason an EMS/XMS driver is not detected
               and Renegade will not load.  By using -D you will
               be able to load Renegade's Overlay to DISK and
               still be able to access the BBS to correct the error.

 14.  CHANGE - TOGGLES.DAT file is removed and is added internal to
               Renegade.  This effects two options.  The option of
               the access for the laston.dat file needs to be rest
               if you changed it.  The toggles are all there and
               must be reset as a few were added.

 15.  ADDED  - User Editor Option '/' key.  This is where you can set
               all defaults for a newuser up to answering all the
               newuser questions, the autoval is still there for after
               these questions are answered.  Prior to this update,
               you couldn't change anything before a newuser was
               validated since they were hard coded in the program.
               Anything you do in Rec 0 (Zero) will carry over past
               autoval if the autoval didn't change the option.

 16.  FIXED  - Display issues with the protocols. The RENEGADE.LNG file
               allowed entry of PROTLIST which displayed a list of
               protocols in addition to the PROT*.ASC files or internal
               protocols. Either delete the PROTLIST entry from
               RENEGADE.LNG or delete PROT*.ASC from the MISC Directory.
               You may also now hide protocols if you do not wish a
               discription to be displayed to the user.

 17.  MISC   - The internal variable for NODE which should have been
               a byte variable was in fact either a word or integer
               variable.  Reduced file reads when listing protocols
               from 3 reads down to 2 reads.  This should make things
               abit faster.

 18.  FIXED  - When updating the node, a comparison of the Node
               number to the Activity was made to set invisible
               mode instead of being compared Node to Node. Removed
               this since Invisible mode is set at Logon and
               via a menu comand.

 19.  FIXED  - The length of the path/filename string for unlisted
               downloads was 78 and the length of the string in
               the batchdl was 65.  Changed both to a length of 52
               (40=Path/12-Filename) to conform with other
               path/filenames used throughout the file system.  A
               length of 78 would have been a waist of space since
               most dl's are listed.

 20.  FIXED  - The download time is now properly updated when
               batchdl's were saved for the next logon.

 21.  CHANGE - The node activity would report that you were in a
               door when uploading files.

 22.  FIXED  - Certain protocols when selected were passed to the
               seek/read procedures that were negative causing a
               runtime error of 100.  This has now been corrected so
               that only numbers from zero and above are passed to
               these procedures.

 23.  FIXED  - Event Editor - If setting an event to SORT FILES,
               this event would never run as the command to SORT
               FILES (ie: S) was not a valid option.  This has been
               corrected.

 24.  UPDATE - The NEW bulletins displayed at logon would occasionaly
               display 0's (Zero) instead of just the bulletins that
               were actually updated since your last logon.  This has
               now been corrected.  Leading zero's were added to those
               bulletin numbers below 10 to make for a better looking
               display when listed.

 25.  ADDED  - Added Menu Option TD to erase BBS's from the BBS
               Listing.  This will be listed in the updated
               MENUCMD.ASC file in the next release.

 25.  ADDED  - Added Menu Command Option (N.) to each menu command.
               This command will update the node activity for each
               command.  If someone is playing LORD, you can set N.
               to "Playing LORD" in the same command as your batch
               file is placed.  No more need to use the NW command
               before and after a cmd is run to update the
               multinode information to Renegade's Who's Online.

                          ********** NOTE ***********

               Activity Field is now able to be a MAXIMUM of 50
               charcters long.

26.    ADDED - New Toggle Option.  Users will now have the option
               of answering a question to be able to logon the BBS
               after forgetting their password.  This can be
               toggled ON/OFF via the toggles menu.  Once the user
               correctly answers the question, they then will be
               able to set a new password before logging onto the
               BBS.  A Mininote to the SysOp will be sent as well
               as a sysop log file line will be written.

27.    ADDED - Sysop Logging for the User Lister and Sysop Logging
               for Todays Callers.  Just to show what the user
               was doing while online. (Nice to know once in a
               while that a command is being used. <G>)

28.    FIXED - The File Sort Routine was setup to access File
               Area 0 which Doesn't exist, so this was changed to
               File Area 01.

29.    FIXED - Logoff time was not properly being passed to the
               SYSOP.LOG file.  Now, the sysop.log file will show
               user logon time, logon node number, what they did
               while online, and logoff time of that node.

30.   CHANGE - Logoff entry in Sysop.Log now indicates Node Number.

31.    FIXED - The Forgot PW question will now redisplay and can
               be edited without retyping the whole damn thing! ;)

32.   CHANGE - The User List can now be viewed a number of different
               ways.  You can view the list via choosing several
               different options to sort it by.  Location, Sex,
               State, etc.  Or you still can view it as it was for
               the last 1000 years. ;)

33.   CHANGE - File Area Toggle Scan Flags (Command)

               Removed the "Q" for quit, pressing <Enter> now quits
               this command and the command no longer scrolls on the
               screen like it did when the "Q" was required.

               Reduced the actual toggling of the scan flags from 3
               separate processes down to just one procedure.

               Pressing "-" alone will now exit vice scrolling the
               command.

               Reduced the input string from 15 down to 9 chars
               since the max range that can be entered is xxxx-xxxx.

               Added an input background.

34.   CHANGE - File Area New Scan Date (Command)

               Removed the extra Line Feed from RENEGADE.LNG File.

               Added error checking for date entered past the
               current date.

               Reduce the input string from 160 down to 10 chars
               since the max length of the date is xx/xx/xxxx.

35.    ADDED - File Tagging to the File areas.  File Names can now
               be downloaded or added to Batch via a simple number
               instead of typing out the full filename each time.
               Batch downloads can be downloaded via XX-YY cmd.
               ie:  4-7, would download files numbered 4, 5, 6, 7.

36.    ADDED - AR Flags - You now have the option to press ? when
               editing user AR Flags.  ARFLAGS.ANS/.ASC is to be put
               in the MISC directory and is used by the SysOp so
               they know which flag is for what and who.  Just a
               simple little reminder.  Hope this helps some.

37.   CHANGE - File Points are now ranged from 0-999 to more closely
               reflect an acutal file point system.  I just can't
               see someone having to pay 32000 points for a file. ;)

38.   CHANGE - At logon, you will be prompted to download files
               in which you have left in your batch queue after
               last logoff.

39.   CHANGE - File Prompt Header - The File Prompt header will
               redisplay at each screen.  No longer will you have
               to wonder which file area you are in.  This gives
               the file system a nice rounded out look as well.

===================================================================
</h1></b></b></b></b></center>
 1.  CHANGE -   Updated Copyright notice to reflect the new year.

 2.  FIXED  -   Slight Memory leak in v01-10.4/DOS.  This in turn would
                cause Renegade to eventuatly eat up all availble memory
                in a few years of use if the computer was never rebooted.

 3.  ADDED  -   /F MENUCMD to disable MCI Codes from displaying inside
                of a text file.  This MENUCMD compliments the -F CMD Key.

 4.  ADDED  -   Option /M when entering a message to turn on or off
                using MCI Codes per message.

 5.  ADDED  -   Added option to allow the SysOp access to the amount
                of time to give each timeslice.  This may help some systems
                in which Renegade hogs a lot of CPU (ie: Windows 2000). If
                you do not have much of a problem with sluggish performance
                it is suggested that you leave this option at the default
                setting. (10-40 optimal setting)

                [System Config -> D. System Variables -> V. Time Slices]

 6.  FIXED  -   Slight problem when displaying "NEW" bulletins to users
                when they first logon.  Renegade would display 22 of them
                across, then start putting each new one on a new line.

 7.  REMOVE -   Removed "Digiboard" support in the codebase.  Really,
                who would use one of those now-a-days anyways with a DOS
                based BBS?  If this is an issue for anyone, please e-mail
                us and we'll take care of it for you.




 8.  ADDED  -   Added option to System Config to post the BBS's telnet
                URL.  This is under System Conifg, Option A Main BBS Config.
                Just a cosmetic add, as before you could only type in a
                telephone number for the BBS.  Now you have a choice. ;)

 9.  ADDED  -   Added ~TN MCI Code to BBSME.ASC/ANS and BBSMN.ASC/ANS
                to reflect the new Telnet address line to the BBS list.

10.  CHANGE -   Changed the follow command keys to reflect new BBS
                list format change.

                       {  See Below for list of CMD Keys  }

                OB : Changed to CMD Key   TV   {short view of bbslist}
                OA : Changed to CMD Key   TA   {Add to bbslist}

                Added the following CMD Keys to be able to have more
                control over the BBS List.

                TA  : BBSList Add           {formally CMD Key OB}
                TE  : BBSList Edit 
                TV  : BBSList Short View    {formally CMD Key OV}
                TX  : BBSList Extended View {formally CMD Key OV}

                { Updated MENUCMD.ASC file to reflect these changes }

11.  CHANGE -   BBS Listing is now scriptable.  This means that you
                now can add just about any question for the BBS you wish.
                MCI Codes reflect the different questions (1-8) to display
                when a user views the BBS List.

                { Added BBSLIST.SCR file to reflect this update }

                *** BBSLIST.SCR MUST BE IN THE \BBS\MISC DIRECTORY ***

12.  ADDED  -   %xA / %xB / %xC / %xD / %xE / %xF for extra definable
                sysop strings in the BBSLIST.SCR file.

                                x:= to the following values.
                a = 8 chars / b = 30 / c = 30 / d = 40 / e = 60 / f = 60

                Also added %S2 for and extra line of descrition of the
                BBS.  Changed the way it stores the SOFTWARE. It's all
                in capital letters now.  Also, added that if can't find
                BBSMN.ASC it will echo back that in the sysop log and
                just print out the bbslist.sysopname, etc and proceed.

13.  ADDED  -   BBS*.ASC New MCI - ~WS (website) ~RN (Record Number)

14.  CHANGE -   -TG and -TS command line loaders for Renegade are
                now simply just -T for all telnet connections.  Unless
                you are using COM/IP as your emulator which the command
                line changed to -TC (ie: renegade.exe -n4 -tc).

16.  UPDATE -   The Official Renegade Home page is now located at URL:
                              http://www.renegadebbs.net

17.  REMOVE -   Removed the "Moving xx to xx" from writing to the
                SYSOPx.LOG file.  Saved some clutter there. ;)

18.  FIXED  -   The Telnet URL will now save correctly in the
                system config and not constantly erase itself.
                Will have to set for each node.

19.  CHANGE -   Bulletins now compare Time and Date of Files vs Time
                and Date of last logon to display as NEW.

20.  CHANGE -   NODE*.ASC instead of showning a '-' when a user isn't
                on a node it will echo back the node number for ~NN, then
                for ~AV it will display 'Y'. MCI Code ~AC is a 20 Chars
                String and ~UN is a 36 character string.

21.  CHANGE -   The Caller ID switch is now -ID instead of just -I
                Also -IP puts the IP (if present) into the Caller ID field
                in the User Editor and anything to do with Caller ID.

22.  ADDED  -   The String Editor is now removed from Renegade.  All
                strings within the editor are now EXTERNAL.  We will
                slowly be removing all strings from within Renegade's
                code and making them external for easy editing!  Also
                created DUMP to "dump" the STRING.DAT file to the
                editable language file. (data\renegade.lng)

  1.  FIXED  - Bulletins - Now will correctly display if a bulletin
               is new or not to the user per call and are sorted
               in numerical order.  ie: (2, 7, 19, 22) instead of
               (22, 2, 19, 7).

  2.  ADDED  - (-T, /T) Toggle.  This will inturn toggle all baud
               rate speeds to show as "TELNET".  This also disables
               most comm routines relating to logoffs.  With -T
               added to loading Renegade, it will no longer pause
               for a set number of seconds before the BBS will
               hang the user up.  DO NOT use this command on
               dialup nodes!  Use this on TELNET ONLY NODES!!!!

   3. REVISED  (-T, /T) (-TG, /TG) (-TS, /TS) Load Toggle.
               This will inturn toggle the MCI Code ~SP in
               the last caller ANSI/ASCII to show 'BAUD'.
               (-T, /T) will do the hang-up procedure on a
               regular log-off for COM/IP.  (-TG, /TG) & (-TS, /TS)
               will bypass the passing of the ATH0 hangup string
               to the fossil/com port and will work with GameSrv
               or Synchronet respectivly.  This fix's issues of
               slow hangups while doing a telnet session.
               DO NOT use this command with dialup nodes!

   3. FIXED  - Fixed Toggles Menu and added warning screen about
               the use of certain toggles and what else should be
               changed or certain users may not be able to log
               back on to the BBS.  (ie:  If you have the BBS
               check for birthday's and have the toggle to ask
               for the birthday at new logon set to NO, the user
               will not be able to logon the BBS since he will not
               have a birthday set in the user record.)

   4. FIXED  - Added Time Slice Routines to certain functions in
               Renegade where it awaits for a user input.  This
               SHOULD fix some slow downs while running under
               some version of Windows.

   5. FIXED  - Fixed Memory problems with downloads and swapping
               Renegade out of memory which in turn caused some
               doors not to function.

   6. CHANGE - Changed all file sizes in Renegade to now show as
               Kilobyte (KB), and Megabytes (MB) instead of just
               bytes. (ie: 64,564 bytes NOW DISPLAYS AS 64.5 KB)
               Also changes to the WFC Screen to reflect this.

   7. FIXED  - Fixed upload Limit of 8.1 MB.  Now, will show
               files with sizes up to 1.9 GB.

   8. FIXED  - Fixed the AR, AC Flags [- OF -] toggle command to
               NOT be case sensitive.

   9. ADDED  - MCI Code telnet - This MCI Code shows the users speed,
               ie: Telnet, Local, or Actual Baud Rate.

  01 -  Made NEWUSER Questions Configurable.  Only questions that are
        required are the User Handle, and User Password.  These toggles
        will be kept in a file called TOGGLES.DAT in the DATA directory.
        If this file is deleted, Renegade will remake the file with the
        defaults. (System Config, N - New User Toggles)

  02 -  Extended FILE_ID.DIZ Description length from 10 lines to 20
        lines.  Read UPDATE.DOC (VERY, VERY IMPORTANT!!!)

  03 -  Fixed:  When a user was downloading or uploading a file, Renegade
        still showed the user was able to be paged to chat.

  04 -  Fixed:  Bug in Renemail which wouldn't allow importing of netmail
        from a FrontEnd Mailer.

			<br/>
  What is Renegade?
			<br/>
  ---------
			<br/>
			<br/>
    Renegade BBS is a bulletin board software derived from the Telegard BBS
			<br/>
v2.5g source code. Telegard is in turn a modified version of the WWIV pascal
			<br/>
source code. Renegade, however has been vastly improved from the original
			<br/>
TG 2.5g source.
			<br/>
			<br/>
    Changes can be browsed from a file known as WHATDONE which list the
			<br/>
hundreds of changes made to the original code. Renegade offers SysOps the
			<br/>
ultimate in BBS configuration, allowing your BBS to achieve a UNIQUE look and
			<br/>
feel.

  Chapter 1-B: Installing Renegade
			<br/>
  ---------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Unzip the distribution archive into a temporary directory, and
			<br/>
run INSTALL.EXE. Answer the questions as you're prompted.
			<br/>
			<br/>
That's it. :)
			<br/>
			<br/>
  ---------------------------
			<br/>
  Chapter 1-C: System Startup and Commandline Parameters
			<br/>
  ---------------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Renegade is started by changing to the main Renegade directory, and
			<br/>
typing 'RENEGADE'. If you do not have a fossil driver installed, you will
			<br/>
receive a message to that effect. If you wish to load Renegade without a
			<br/>
fossil driver, you must do so in Local mode, using the -L parameter,
			<br/>
detailed below.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Renegade accepts the following Commandline Parameters:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -?        This command displays a quick help screen of all
			<br/>
                  the commands listed below.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Bnnnnn   This command tells the BBS that a user is already
			<br/>
                  connected at nnnnn baud. When loading Renegade
			<br/>
                  with this parameter, the WFC screen will be skipped
			<br/>
                  and the user will be dropped directly into the logon
			<br/>
                  sequence.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -F        This command starts the FILES.BBS Importer.  It will
			<br/>
                  check all file areas for a FILES.BBS file, import the
			<br/>
                  files, then exit.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                  File_ID.DIZ will only be checked if allowed by System 
			<br/>
                  Config setting for this option.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -EEnnn    If a critical error occurs during the operation of the
			<br/>
                  BBS, it aborts to DOS with an ERRORLEVEL value of nnn.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -ENnnn    Whenever a user logs off, and the -Q parameter is
			<br/>
                  specified on the commandline, Renegade returns an
			<br/>
                  errorlevel of 0 if no new echomail was entered, and
			<br/>
                  an errorlevel of 2 if new echomail was entered. This
			<br/>
                  commandline changes the errorlevel Renegade will
			<br/>
                  exit with to nnn.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                  NOTE: When pressing Q from the WFC screen, Renegade will
			<br/>
                        exit with an errorlevel of 255, regardless of whether
			<br/>
                        or not this parameter is used.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Ixxx     If you wish to pass Called ID information to Renegade,
			<br/>
                  use this parameter. This is most likely to be used in
			<br/>
                  conjunction with a Front-End Mailer that supports Caller
			<br/>
                  ID.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -L        This tells Renegade to load itself in local mode. While
			<br/>
                  in local mode, Renegade will ignore the modem entirely (it
			<br/>
                  won't send anything out to the modem, and won't respond to
			<br/>
                  incoming calls)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Mn       Will create a QWK mail packet for user n then return
			<br/>
                  to DOS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Nn       Specifies which node to load (ie, -N1 loads Node 1, -N2
			<br/>
                  loads Node2, etc.). *Make Certain* that you've turned
			<br/>
                  multinode support on in the Main System Configuration before
			<br/>
                  you implement this parameter on your commandline.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -P        Pack the message bases and return to DOS. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -S        Sort the File areas and return to DOS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -T        Tells Renegade to run in "TELNET" Mode.  Use this option
			<br/>
                  when running Renegade with such servers as NET2BBS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -TC       Tells Renegade to run in "COM PORT TELNET" mode.  Use
			<br/>
                  this option when running with COM/IP or NetSerial.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Q        Quit to DOS instead of the WFC screen upon logoff.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Un       Will upload a REP mail packet for user n then return to
			<br/>
                  DOS.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -Xnnnn    External event start time in nnnn minutes.  Renegade will
			<br/>
                  treat this as a built in hard event and log the user off
			<br/>
                  in nnnn minutes.

			<br/>
                    normally not used, but for testing the connections and
			<br/>
                    when you have an error, this is helpful. If everything is
			<br/>
                    configured correctly, the BBS should automatically answer
			<br/>
                    the phone.

			<br/>
                    255.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          R         Prompts for a username, and then displays the contents

          [TAB]     Switches you between modem and WFC mode.  In modem mode,
			<br/>
                    you can send commands to the modem, but if the phone
			<br/>
                    rings, Renegade will still answer the call.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          If Local Security Protection is turned On (See Chapter 6-E),
			<br/>
          then only two commands are available from the WFC Screen; [SPACE]
			<br/>
          and Q. Pressing Q will exit to DOS, just like the normal WFC
			<br/>
          command. [SPACE] will bring up a prompt for the sysop password.
			<br/>
          If the password is entered correctly, then the WFC can be used
			<br/>
          normally. If someone logs on, when they logoff the WFC screen
			<br/>
          will blank and then ask for the Password again. If the password
			<br/>
          is entered, and the WFC screen remains idle, after a time it'll
			<br/>
          prompt for the password again before functioning normally.

  Chapter 2 - Sysop Function Keys
			<br/><br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
     The following function keys are available only when a user is online:
			<br/>
     (Alt-x, where x is the letter you're pressing; Alt key+x key together)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-A          Toggles SysOp Window ON or OFF.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-B          Toggles "beep-after-end" on and off.  This feature
			<br/>
                         will take the phone offhook and sound an alarm when
			<br/>
                         the user logs off, letting you know that the system
			<br/>
                         is available for use.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-C          Toggles chat mode on and off.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-E          Allows modification of the user's security
			<br/>
                         information (SL, DSL, AR & AC flags, file points).
			<br/>
                         Prints the "SysOp working" string to the user while
			<br/>
                         this window is displayed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-F          Prints fake line noise to the user.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-G          Allows enabling and disabling of activity trapping
			<br/>
                         and chat capturing for a user.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-H          Hang up on a user and return to the WFC menu.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-I          Toggles the User's input On and Off. For the
			<br/>
                         obvious reasons, user input is toggled On. If
			<br/>
                         toggled Off, then the users keystrokes won't do
			<br/>
                         anything.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-K          Allows you to select a Hangup message to display
			<br/>
                         (HANGUPnn.*) before hanging up on the user and
			<br/>
                         returning to the WFC menu.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         This option has caused an undue amount of confusion
			<br/>
                         in it's time. When you press Alt-K, the following
			<br/>
                         prompt appears in the Sysop Window.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         Display what hangup file (HANGUPxx) :
			<br/>
                          >
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         The prompt is misleading; it can be interpreted
			<br/>
                         as telling a sysop to input the entire filename
			<br/>
                         of the hangup file they want to display.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         Uh uh. Let's say you've got hangup files HANGUP1.ASC
			<br/>
                         and HANGUP11.ANS. In order for the file to display,
			<br/>
                         you must type the number of the HANGUP file and
			<br/>
                         nothing more. Ie; When you want to display
			<br/>
                         HANGUP1.ASC, you would type 1 when prompted. If you
			<br/>
                         wanted to display HANGUP11.ANS, you'd type 11.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         The prompt is also misleading in that it shows it'll
			<br/>
                         accept two characters. It is okay to use 1 character,
			<br/>
                         as in HANGUP1.ASC above. Renegade won't complain.
			<br/>
                         However, if you named the file HANGUP01.ASC and then
			<br/>
                         pressed 1 at the prompt, HANGUP01.ASC would not
			<br/>
                         display; Renegade would be looking for 01, not 1.
			<br/>
                         Basically, whatever you input is what Renegade is
			<br/>
                         going to be looking for after the HANGUP portion of
			<br/>
                         the filename.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-L          Toggles the local screen on and off.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-M          Toggles temporary SysOp access for a user. If the
			<br/>
                         user still has Temp SysOp access when they logoff,
			<br/>
                         they will be returned to their original status
			<br/>
                         when next they call.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-N          Switches you to the next SysOp window in order.
			<br/>
                         Sysop Window must be turned on; see Alt-S
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-O          Conference System toggle. If toggled to off, any
			<br/>
                         access levels requiring the user to be in a certain
			<br/>
                         conference are ignored. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-P          Displays a file from the local harddisk to the
			<br/>
                         remote user.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-Q          Turns off the "user attempted to chat" alarm.
			<br/>
                         If a user pages the sysop when he's available and
			<br/>
                         the sysop doesn't answer, this annoying little
			<br/>
                         pager sound will continue. The only way to stop
			<br/>
                         it is to break into chat with the user, wait until
			<br/>
                         they logoff, or use Alt-Q. :)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-R          Displays the chat reason in the SysOp window.
			<br/>
                         Sysop Window must be turned on; see Alt-S
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-S          Enters SysOp/User Split Screen Chat Mode.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-T          Toggles the SysOp window display between the top
			<br/>
                         and bottom of the local screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-U          Toggles the user's input and output on and off.
			<br/>
                         Users input and output is toggled on at the
			<br/>
                         beginning of each call by default. If toggled
			<br/>
                         off, then the users keystrokes will not do anything.
			<br/>
                         In addition, the remote display will no longer
			<br/>
                         be updated; the remote user's screen is in essence
			<br/>
                         frozen until the sysop presses Alt-U again, or the
			<br/>
                         caller hangs up.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-V          Prompts the sysop for a validation level (as
			<br/>
                         defined in Subscription/Validation levels; See
			<br/>
                         Chapter 6-G) and then validates the online user
			<br/>
                         at the chosen level.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-W          Same as Alt-E except that the "SysOp working"
			<br/>
                         string is not displayed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-Z          Sends a continuous stream of beeps until the user
			<br/>
                         presses a key or hangs up.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-+          Adds five minutes to a user's total time left.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-          Subtracts five minutes from a user's total time
			<br/>
                         left.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-(F1-F5)    Changes to SysOp Window 1-5 depending on which
			<br/>
                         Function key you hit (F1-F5). Sysop Window must
			<br/>
                         be turned on; see Alt-S
			<br/>
			<br/>
          F1-F10         Hitting one of these keys will activate the SysOp
			<br/>
                         Defined Macro that was defined in System Variables.
			<br/>
                         (See Chapter 6-D)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Ctrl-Home      Shows a help screen with all of the SysOp function
			<br/>
                         keys and a brief description.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     The following function keys are available anywhere in the system,
			<br/>
     whether or not a user is online:
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-n          Executes a batch file called "GLOBATn.BAT", where
			<br/>
                         "n" is a number from 1 to 9. (ie, if you have a batch
			<br/>
                         file named GLOBAT1.BAT, and press Alt-1, Renegade
			<br/>
                         will immediately run that batch file, Alt-2 runs
			<br/>
                         GLOBAT2.BAT, and so on)
			<br/>
			<br/>
                         The GLOBATn.BAT files must be present in your main
			<br/>
                         BBS directory.                        
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-D          Prompts for a filename and then captures the contents
			<br/>
                         of the screen to that filename. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Alt-J          Performs a local shell to DOS. Sends the "SysOp
			<br/>
                         has shelled to DOS" string before entering DOS,
			<br/>
                         and the "thank you for waiting" string after
			<br/>
                         returning.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Scroll Lock    Toggles Sysop Availability for chat. If On, Sysop
			<br/>
                         is *not* available for chat at all. If Off, then
			<br/>
                         the regularly defined chat hours are used (if none
			<br/>
                         are defined, then the sysop pager will always be
			<br/>
                         active, unless Scroll Lock is turned On)
			<br/>
			<br/>
          Ctrl-SysRq     Allows the SysOp to choose to generate a run
			<br/>
                         time error. (Cute, huh? :))

          "FS"   - Must have AR flag "S".
			<br/>
          "T20"  - Must have at least 20 minutes time left.
			<br/>
          "Y360" - Must be later than 6:00 am.
			<br/>
          "N1ER"   - Must be logged onto node 1 with RIP active.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     For added ACS control, there are five logical operators that can be
			<br/>
     used.
			<br/>
			<br/>
      For access to happen:
			<br/>
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			<br/>
          "&" - Logical AND   - both must be true
			<br/>
          "|" - Logical OR    - either can be true
			<br/>
          "!" - Logical NOT   - first is true second isn't
			<br/>
			<br/>
      These are the all on/off settings:
			<br/>
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			<br/>
          "^" - Logical TRUE  - everything is true
			<br/>
          "%" - Logical FALSE - everything is false
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Examples:
			<br/>
     ~~~~~~~~
			<br/>
      AND - "S20D50" requires the user has an SL of 20 *AND* a DSL of 50.
			<br/>
      OR  - "S20|FA" requires that the user have either SL 20 *OR* AR flag "A".
			<br/>
      NOT - "!FA" requires that the user *NOT* have AR flag "A".
			<br/>
			<br/>
     The TRUE and FALSE operators are used to give everyone access, or to
			<br/>
     give nobody access.  "^" means ALL users have access, and "%"
			<br/>
     means NO users at all have access.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     For even more complex ACS's, parentheses are allowed to group ACS settings
			<br/>
     together to be compared to another set:
			<br/>
     "S20FA|D255" means that the user must have at least SL 20 *AND* AR flag
			<br/>
     "A" *OR* DSL 255.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     A few more examples:
			<br/>
			<br/>
          S50            User must have SL 50 or higher (50-255).
			<br/>
          !S50           User must *NOT* have SL 50 (0-49).
			<br/>
          VV|U1          User must be validated *OR* be user #1.
			<br/>
          A21FAS50       User must be 21 years old *AND* have AR flag "A"
			<br/>
                         *AND* have SL 50.
			<br/>
          !(A21FAS50)    User must *NOT* be 21 years old, have AR flag "A",
			<br/>
                         or have SL 50.
			<br/>
          !N234          User must *NOT* be logged onto node 234.

 Chapter 4 - Special Files
			<br/><br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
  Unless otherwise noted, all files mentioned in this section must be present
			<br/>
  in your MISC directory off the Renegade main path.
			<br/>
			<br/>
  -------------
			<br/>
  Chapter 4-A: The BBS List
			<br/>
  -------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
      Renegade's BBS List is now in binary format. It stores more information,
			<br/>
      and allows the person entering the BBS into the list to edit the
			<br/>
      information later. It displays in two formats, regular (the short,
			<br/>
      traditional format) and an extended version that includes much more
			<br/>
      thorough information. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
      The BBS List will now sort itself automatically, so no third party
			<br/>
      utils will be required. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
            Regular List:
			<br/>
			<br/>
              You can configure the format of the regular list with
			<br/>
              the following three files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
              BBSNH.xxx <- The Header 
			<br/>
              BBSNT.xxx <- The Trailer
			<br/>
              BBSMN.xxx <- The information displayed in between
			<br/>
			<br/>
            Extended Format:
			<br/>
			<br/>
              You can configure the format of the extended list with
			<br/>
              the following three files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
               BBSEH.xxx <- The Header
			<br/>
               BBSET.xxx <- The Trailer
			<br/>
               BBSME.xxx <- The information displayed in between
			<br/>
			<br/>
      In BBSMx.xxx, you can use the following local MCI codes:
			<br/>
			<br/>
    ~BN   BBS Name      ~DA   Date Added        ~DE   Date Edited
			<br/>
    ~DS   Description   ~PN   Phone Number      ~SN   SysOp Name
			<br/>
    ~SP   Speed         ~SW   Software          ~UN   User Added
			<br/>
			<br/>
      You are limited to 1024 bytes in BBSMx.xxx and all other configurable
			<br/>
      listings. Since this is for each entry, and *before* MCI interpretation,
			<br/>
      if you use that much, people are going to fall asleep waiting for the
			<br/>
      listing to end.
			<br/>

			<br/>
      Middle: LASTM.xxx
			<br/>
      Trailer: LASTT.xxx
			<br/>
			<br/>
      You can customize LASTM.xxx with the following local MCI codes:
			<br/>
			<br/>
~CA   Caller number     ~DK   Download Kbytes       ~DL   Downloads

      Middle: NODELM.xxx
			<br/>
      Trailer: NODELT.xxx
			<br/>
			<br/>
     You can customize NODELM.xxx with the following local MCI codes:
			<br/>
			<br/>
    ~AC  Activity           ~AG  Age        ~AT  Node active (Y/N)

    ~NN  Node number        ~UN  Name       ~RM  Room number
			<br/>
    ~SX  Sex
			<br/>

    All of these MCI codes return "-" when a user is not on that node,
			<br/>
    or is invisible.

  Chapter 4-E: The Trashcan File
			<br/>
  ---------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
This file has gone undocumented for a very long time. :) What it is, simply,
			<br/>
is a plaintext file called TRASHCAN.TXT in your MISC directory containing the
			<br/>
names of people, or words, that you do not want to be able to apply to your
			<br/>
system. The format is one name per line, one after the other.
			<br/>
			<br/>
 Example:
			<br/>
			<br/>
    --BEGIN FILE--
			<br/>
    Ken Reaverson
			<br/>
    Adrian Blood
			<br/>
    Pretty Hate Machine
			<br/>
    --END FILE--
			<br/>
			<br/>
If I were to apply to your board, and this is what your TRASHCAN.TXT looked
			<br/>
like, I would receive the message 'Sorry, can't use that name' and prompted
			<br/>
to enter my name/handle again. It is not case sensitive, but it is spelling
			<br/>
sensitive. Also, there are no wildcards allowed (Adrian* will not prevent
			<br/>
Adrian Paul, Adrian Blood, or Adrian Blackburn from applying to your system
			<br/>
;))
			<br/>
			<br/>
  ----------------
			<br/>
  Chapter 4-F: The NEWLET.ASC File
			<br/>
  ----------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        This file, if it exists, will be sent to a new user when his account
			<br/>
        is saved to the user record. The file should be left in the MISC
			<br/>
        directory. It has the following format:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -----------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        [FROM]
			<br/>
        [SUBJECT]
			<br/>
        { MESSAGE TEXT (FIRST LINE)
			<br/>
                .
			<br/>
                .
			<br/>
                .
			<br/>
          (LAST LINE) }
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
        -----------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Each is on a separate line, and FROM is on the first line.  Any
			<br/>
        replies to this message are sent to the same user number as the
			<br/>
        new user application.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<br/>
  Chapter 4-G: The Global Menu
			<br/>
  --------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The Global Menu is an optional menu that can do some pretty cool
			<br/>
        stuff. Any command inserted into the global menu can be run from
			<br/>
        anywhere on the BBS. All regular Menu CmdKeys will work, with one
			<br/>
        exception. The GOSUB (-/) command will not work from the Global Menu.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        If the Global Menu is not already present, you'll have to create
			<br/>
        it yourself. Be very careful how you assign commands on the Global
			<br/>
        Menu. Make sure that the letters you assign aren't used anywhere
			<br/>
        else on the BBS, or they'll be run in sequence, and the results
			<br/>
        will probably be something different than what you had hoped for.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Example:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Let's say I want to insert a command that will check and see
			<br/>
        what users are online. I create a menu named GLOBAL.MNU in my
			<br/>
        MENU directory. I load up the Menu Editor and insert a new command
			<br/>
        that looks something like this:
			<br/>
			<br/>
        Menu filename: GLOBAL
			<br/>
        Command #1 of 2
			<br/>
			<br/>
        1. Long descript :(/W)ho's Online
			<br/>
        2. Short descript:(/W)ho's Online
			<br/>
        3. Menu keys     :/W
			<br/>
        4. ACS required  :""
			<br/>
        5. Cmdkeys       :NO
			<br/>
                         ;(This is the CmdKey for the Who's On List)
			<br/>
        6. Options       :
			<br/>
        N. Node Activity :Who's Online?
			<br/>
                         ;(This is diplayed in Node Activity)
			<br/>
        T. Flags         :-
			<br/>
        Q. Quit
			<br/>
			<br/>
        From now on, no matter where I am, if I press /W, the Who's On List
			<br/>
        will display. Now, imagine if I had assigned the Menu Key as L
			<br/>
        instead of /W. If that had been the case, anywhere there was an L
			<br/>
        command already present, it would have run the present command first,
			<br/>
        and then the global one. So at the Main Menu, the Callers Today list
			<br/>
        would have displayed, followed immediately by the Whos On list.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        If you had to create the GLOBAL.MNU yourself, delete the Quit to
			<br/>
        Main Menu command already present in the menu; it's redundant.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        If there's a menu you *don't* want using the global commands, you can
			<br/>
        turn them off. Most of the default menus allow the use of the Global
			<br/>
        commands, and all new menus you create default to being able to use
			<br/>
        the menu commands. See Chapter 11-B for information on changing
			<br/>
        whether or not a menu uses the global commands.
			<br/>
			<br/>

			<br/>
  Chapter 4-H: The READP, FILEP, and NEWINFO Menus
			<br/>
  ------------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
        All three of the menus in this section must exist in the MENUS.DAT
			<br/>
        file in the DATA directory off the main Renegade Path.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        READP
			<br/>
			<br/>
        This is the menu that's used while reading any message on the BBS.
			<br/>
        Do *not* delete this file under any circumstance, and do not
			<br/>
        rename it. Renegade looks for the filename READP MENU, bad things
			<br/>
        happen when it doesn't exist. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        You can change the menu prompt, add in extra commands, and modify
			<br/>
        it just like any other menu, just be careful to keep the message
			<br/>
        reading and replying commands there. ;)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        FILEP
			<br/>
			<br/>
        The FILEP MENU serves the same function as the READP MENU, except
			<br/>
        it's used when listing files. The cautions with the READP MENU
			<br/>
        apply here as well, do *not* delete or rename this file.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        NEWINFO
			<br/>
			<br/>
        As above, do not delete or rename this file, Renegade expects it,
			<br/>
        and new users won't be able to complete the application process if
			<br/>
        it doesn't exist.
			<br/>
			<br/>
        This is the final step before the user is actually saved to the
			<br/>
        user record. At this menu, they can change the information they've
			<br/>
        been asked during the application process. It is important to note;
			<br/>
        while at this menu, the user does not have a user number. Do not
			<br/>
        use any commands which will check for a user number, because it'll
			<br/>
        bomb out.
			<br/>

 Chapter 5 - Changing Colors
			<br/><br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
     There are 2 easy ways of changing colors in Renegade.  The first
			<br/>
     method is usable almost everywhere in Renegade.  When you're where you
			<br/>
     want to change to another color, press [Ctrl-P] and then enter a number
			<br/>
     from 0-9.  Control-P is actually a macro type of key, because when you
			<br/>
     do hit Control P, a ^ appears.  The ^ is the actual, better way to change
			<br/>
     the colors.  From then on, the color will be the one you set with the last
			<br/>
     command.  It will stay the same color until the color is changed again by
			<br/>
     either the system or by another color code sequence.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
            NOTE: Just because the [Ctrl-P] key sequence does not produce
			<br/>
            ~~~~  the "^", doesn't mean you cannot change the color.  Simply
			<br/>
                  enter the "^" yourself.
			<br/>
			<br/>
            NOTE: As of 4-05 Exp, pressing Ctrl-P then the # will produce
			<br/>
                  the string. ie, [ctrl-p] 1 will produce "^1". In
			<br/>
                  previous versions, the color change was instant and
			<br/>
                  the user never saw the ^# part of the string.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Another way which can be used is called the Pipe System.  Where you
			<br/>
     want to change the color, enter a "|nn" (w/out quotes).  The nn is a
			<br/>
     number between 00 and 23. (2 digits MUST be used.).  The first 16 colors
			<br/>
     (00-15) affect the foreground color, and the last 8 (16-23) affect the
			<br/>
     background color.  The colors are as follows: (B. = Bright, D. = Dark)
			<br/>
			<br/>
        00: Black       08: D. Grey     16: Black
			<br/>
        01: Blue        09: B. Blue     17: Blue
			<br/>
        02: Green       10: B. Green    18: Green
			<br/>
        03: Cyan        11: B. Cyan     19: Cyan
			<br/>
        04: Red         12: B. Red      20: Red
			<br/>
        05: Purple      13: B. Purple   21: Purple
			<br/>
        06: Brown       14: Yellow      22: Brown
			<br/>
        07: Grey        15: B. White    23: White
			<br/>
			<br/>
      NOTE: On some cases, if you have used the ^# method of changing colors
			<br/>
      ~~~~  and the color you changed to with the ^ was flashing, you might
			<br/>
            have to enter another NON-FLASHING ^ code before you enter
			<br/>
            a pipe code.

 Chapter 6 - System Configuration
			<br/><br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
   The main part of keeping Renegade set and going is the way you set up the
			<br/>
   system configuration.  This section is normally selected by the "S" command
			<br/>
   at the WFC screen.
			<br/>
			<br/>
     Once there, the following menu is displayed:

 -------------------------------------
			<br/>
			<br/>
          A    This option allows you to enter the name and the phone
			<br/>
               number of your BBS. The Name defined here is what will be
			<br/>
               displayed by the %BN MCI Code, and the Phone number is what
			<br/>
               will be displayed by the %BP MCI Code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          B    This allows you to enter a telnet address for the BBS. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
          C    This option allows you to enter the username of the SysOp.
			<br/>
               This is mostly cosmetic; the only thing this option determines
			<br/>
               is what the %SN MCI Code will display.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          D    Displays Renegade's version.  This cannot be changed and is
			<br/>
               here only for show.  This is what is shown with the %VR MCI
			<br/>
               Code.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          E    This option allows you to declare your chat hours.  When
			<br/>
               someone pages you during these hours, a bell will sound to
			<br/>
               inform you that a user wishes to chat.
			<br/>
			<br/>
               NOTE: If you do not declare chat hours, your users will
			<br/>
                     be able to page you at all hours.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          F    This option defines the hours that the minimum baud rate
			<br/>
               callers may log on.  Some SysOps prefer to restrict the hours
			<br/>
               available to users of lower baud modems for various reasons.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          G    This option defines the hours that file downloading is
			<br/>
               allowed.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          H    This option defines the hours that low baud callers may
			<br/>
               download files.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          I    This option brings up something like the following display:
			<br/>
			<br/>
                        System Passwords:
			<br/>
                          A. SysOp password        :
			<br/>
                          B. New user password     :
			<br/>
                          C. Baud override password:
			<br/>
			<br/>
                             A. Defines the SysOp Password. This is the only
			<br/>
                                one of the three passwords that must be
			<br/>
                                defined. In general, this is the password
			<br/>
                                that will be prompted for when using all
			<br/>
                                Sysop specific commands.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                             B. If this is defined, then any newuser applying
			<br/>
                                to the system will need to input this password
			<br/>
                                when prompted before continuing with the
			<br/>
                                application process. If this password is
			<br/>
                                not defined, then nothing will be asked for,
			<br/>
                                and a user may apply to the system unhindered.
			<br/>
			<br/>
                             C. If this password is defined and a user
			<br/>
                                connects at a baud rate lower than the
			<br/>
                                minimum logon baud rate defined in the
			<br/>
                                System Variables (See Chapter 6-D), then
			<br/>
                                the user will be prompted for this password.
			<br/>
                                If they get it right, they'll be allowed
			<br/>
                                to logon. If they get it wrong, Renegade
			<br/>
                                will hang up on them. If the password
			<br/>
                                is not defined and a user connects at a
			<br/>
                                lower baud rate than allowed, they'll simply
			<br/>
                                be hung up on.
			<br/>
			<br/>
          J    This options sets the number of seconds before a scheduled
			<br/>
               event is run in which the user is warned. In other words,
			<br/>
               if you've got an event running in two minutes, and this option
			<br/>
               is set to 60 seconds, Renegade would warn the user one minute
			<br/>
               before the event logged them off. If you an event was about
			<br/>
               to run in 5 minutes, and this option was set to 300 seconds,
			<br/>
               then the user would be warned five minutes in advance.

          L    Prefix of the Bulletin Files. (Normally left Blank or set to

				<br/>
               OS CmdKey for an explanation.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          M    This option allows you to tell Renegade if it has 1 or more
				<br/>
               nodes.  (If multi-node, you must use the -Nx command to load
				<br/>
               node x.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          N    This option will allow you to turn the Network mode on.  It
				<br/>
               activates the following:
				<br/>
				<br/>
                a) Forces local security on.
				<br/>
                b) Disables all function keys unless a SysOp is logged on.
				<br/>
                c) Disables the SysOp window system.
				<br/>
                d) All WFC commands are disabled except [SPACE] and Q.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
          0    This option defines the directory in which your main data
				<br/>
               files are stored. (.DAT, .DIR, etc.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          1    This option defines the directory in which your text files
				<br/>
               are stored.  (.ANS, .ASC, .INF, .ASW, etc.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          2    This option defines the directory in which your messages
				<br/>
               are stored. (.BRD, .MIX, etc.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          3    This option defines the directory in which the menu files
				<br/>
               are stored. (.MNU)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          4    This option defines the directory in which the Version 7
				<br/>
               Nodelist files will be stored. A Version 7 Nodelist is
				<br/>
               something compiled by a third party program. It is *not*
				<br/>
               the text file containing names, locations and phone numbers,
				<br/>
               and so on; that's the raw nodelist. The author of this
				<br/>
               documentation recommends QNode, written by James West, which
				<br/>
               should be available on any decent support BBS.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               What a Version 7 Nodelist does is aid in sending Netmail.
				<br/>
               If a Version 7 Nodelist exists, Renegade is able to fill
				<br/>
               in most of the blanks for you. When sending netmail without
				<br/>
               a Version 7 Nodelist defined, Renegade will ask for the
				<br/>
               following: Name of recipient, their address, and then the
				<br/>
               subject. It is quite possible for a message to be addressed
				<br/>
               incorrectly in this manner. If a Version 7 nodelist is
				<br/>
               defined, Renegade is a little more helpful; When sending
				<br/>
               Netmail, Renegade will ask for either a name or address:
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Enter a name, a Fidonet address, or an Internet address.
				<br/>
               :
				<br/>
				<br/>
               The Name it's looking for in this case is the name of the
				<br/>
               sysop, which is not necessarily the person you want to
				<br/>
               address the netmail to. If you don't know the name of the
				<br/>
               sysop, but you do know the address, use it. If you enter
				<br/>
               an invalid address, Renegade will form you of as much and
				<br/>
               ask you to try again. If you enter a valid address, a screen
				<br/>
               something like the following pops up:
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Enter a name, a Fidonet address, or an Internet address.
				<br/>
               :1:1/105
				<br/>
				<br/>
               System: The Titantic BBS (1:1/105)
				<br/>
               SysOp : T.J. McMillen 
				<br/>
               Phone : -UnPublished- 
				<br/>
               Where : Pennsylvania
				<br/>
               Cost  : 0 credits
				<br/>
				<br/>
               Is this correct? No
				<br/>
				<br/>
               If you confirm this is the correct information, Renegade will
				<br/>
               next ask who you want this addressed this netmail (it'll fill
				<br/>
               in the sysops name by default).
				<br/>
				<br/>
               By using a Version 7 nodelist, the mail isn't going to be
				<br/>
               addressed to a non-existent node. It also makes a user confirm
				<br/>
               their choice, thereby lessening the chances of accidentally
				<br/>
               addressing the netmail somewhere else.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          5    This option defines the directory in which the trap files,
				<br/>
               system log files and capture chat files are stored. (.LOG)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          6    This option defines the directory in which temporary files
				<br/>
               are stored.  This directory is used for various things to
				<br/>
               hold files while using them, but when they aren't permanent.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          7    This option defines the directory in which the protocol drivers
				<br/>
               will be held.  These include DSZ.EXE, HSLINK.EXE, etc. These
				<br/>
               files are used in the Protocol Editor as your file transfer
				<br/>
               programs.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          8    This option defines the directory in which the archive drivers
				<br/>
               will be held.  These include PKUNZIP.EXE, ARJ.EXE, PKZIP.EXE,
				<br/>
               RAR.EXE, etc.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          9    This is the directory in which your external string text files
				<br/>
               are stored.  Both compiled and raw.

     Note that the command strings can contain the following special
				<br/>
     characters:
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "|"       Sends a carriage return (^M) to the modem.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "^x"      Sends a control character to the modem. (^M can be typed
				<br/>
                    as a | here.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "~"       Performs a half-second delay before sending the next
				<br/>
                    character to the modem.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          "^"       Toggles DTR for .25 seconds.
				<br/>
				<br/>
     Each menu option is described in detail below.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          1    This is where you can set the maximum baud rate of your
				<br/>
               modem. If you're locking the COM port, this is the speed
				<br/>
               at which the port will be locked.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          2    This is the COM port that this nodes modem is connected to,
				<br/>
               which can be COM1 through COM64.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          3    This is the command that initializes the modem.  This is
				<br/>
               VERY important, as it tells the modem how to operate under
				<br/>
               the BBS environment.

               Words of Advice: If your modem has the ability to store user

                                profiles in its volatile memory, use it.
				<br/>
                                Renegade likes a short init string.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          4    This is the command that Renegade sends to the modem in order
				<br/>
               to answer an incoming call.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          5    This is the command that hangs up the modem.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          6    This is the command that places the modem (and, consequently,
				<br/>
               the phone line) offhook.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          7    This option toggles whether or not the COM port is locked. If
				<br/>
               your modem supports rates above 2400 baud, make sure this
				<br/>
               is set to On.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          8    This option toggles XON/XOFF flow control on and off. (See
				<br/>
               information above about CTS/RTS flow control.  XON/XOFF is
				<br/>
               also known as Software Flow Control.) Pick one or the other,
				<br/>
               but don't use both. The CTS/RTS is the preferable Flow Control.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          9    This option toggles CTS/RTS flow control on or off.  Flow
				<br/>
               control tells the computer or modem when to start and stop
				<br/>
               sending or receiving information to/from the other device.
				<br/>
               (CTS/RTS is also known as Hardware Flow Control.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          A    A User must meet the ACS that is set here in order to login
				<br/>
               to this node. If they do not, when they login, the BBS will
				<br/>
               hang up on them.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          B    The complete path to where the door files (CALLINFO.BBS,
				<br/>
               DORINFOx.DEF, DOOR.SYS, etc.) will be written for this node.
				<br/>
               (If blank, files are written to main BBS directory)
				<br/>
				<br/>
               If you define this directory, you must create it. Renegade will
				<br/>
               not do it for you.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          C    If you want the BBS to answer on a ring other then the first
				<br/>
               ring, enter the number here.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          D    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
				<br/>
               of normal text sent from this node while in Teleconference.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          E    This will toggle the option to use the MultiRing (also called
				<br/>
               RingMate, and Distinctive Ringing) option.  (Pick up after the
				<br/>
               set number of secondary rings.)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          F    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
				<br/>
               of an anonymous message sent from this node while in
				<br/>
               Teleconference.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          G    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
				<br/>
               of a message sent from this node to the users current
				<br/>
               Global Channel while in Teleconference. (see Chapter 20
				<br/>
               for more information on Teleconference and Global Channels)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          H    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
				<br/>
               of a Private message sent from this node while in
				<br/>
               Teleconference.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          I    Important Note: This option does *not* tell Renegade which
				<br/>
               IRQ to use for this node. This option is cosmetic only; the
				<br/>
               value here is what will be shown by the %E MCI Code.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          J    Important Note: This option does *not* tell Renegade what
				<br/>
               port address to use for this node. This option is cosmetic
				<br/>
               only; the value defined here is what will be shown by the %C
				<br/>
               MCI Code.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               If you need to set the comport to use a different IRQ and
				<br/>
               port address, you must do this through your fossil driver,
				<br/>
               not Renegade.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          R    These are the result codes returned by the modem when the NO
				<br/>
               CARRIER and other various baud rate conditions are encountered.

				<br/>
				<br/>
      A-D, and G through X are default result codes, and for all Hayes
				<br/>
      Compatible modems, these shouldn't be changed.
				<br/>
				<br/>
      E is the string that is received when you get CID information. Different
				<br/>
      modems use different strings; some use NMBR =, some use CALR =. Check
				<br/>
      your modems manual to find out which one you support.
				<br/>
				<br/>
      F is a toggle for CID.  If you want the information (Phone Number,
				<br/>
      Name, etc.) to be inserted in the User's User Note, toggle this on.
				<br/>
      If you don't have CID, or don't want it inserted in the Note, leave
				<br/>
      this off.

     --------------------------------
				<br/>
				<br/>
          A    This setting defines the security level for a full SysOp.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               NOTE: This also defines the level for which the //\\XX global
				<br/>
                     command keys can be set. I highly recommend this be
				<br/>
                     set to u1 instead of s255.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          B    This is the ACS Level that a user must have in order to
				<br/>
               be qualified as a Full Co-Sysop.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          C    This setting defines the security level for a message base
				<br/>
               SysOp.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          D    This setting defines the security level for a file base
				<br/>
               SysOp.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               NOTE: C and D are more or less obsolete these days. With
				<br/>
               the addition of the FILEP and READP menus, a sysop can
				<br/>
               change who has access to what commands. In addition, each
				<br/>
               message base has it's own setting for Sysop ACS. You can
				<br/>
               change the strings as they're defined here, but they don't
				<br/>
               really do anything. :)
				<br/>
				<br/>
          E    This setting defines the security level in which the SysOp
				<br/>
               password must be specified during the logon process.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          F    This is the access needed to add a voting choice when the
				<br/>
               topic is added with "add choices off".
				<br/>
				<br/>
          G    This setting defines the security level required to post
				<br/>
               normal public mail.
				<br/>
				<br/>
          H    This setting is similar to option G, except that it pertains
				<br/>
               to normal Email.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               NOTE: If you set this to a higher ACS than a New User who
				<br/>
               has just applied to the system has, they *will not* be able
				<br/>
               to send a newuser letter to the sysop. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
          I    If a user qualifies for this ACS level, they will be able to
				<br/>
               see the real name or handle on any anonymous public messages.
				<br/>
				<br/>
               The message header would look something like this:

						<br/>
               pertains to normal Email instead of public messages.

						<br/>
          K    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
						<br/>
               to post anonymously on ANY message base. If a user meets this
						<br/>
               ACS, it will override the individual anonymous settings for
						<br/>
               each individual message base (the one exception to this is if
						<br/>
               it's set to %; if % is used, then the individual base settings
						<br/>
               will still be honored.) If you use ^ here, then users will be
						<br/>
               able to post anonymously on any public message base, regardless
						<br/>
               of the individual settins.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This setting is similar to option K, except that it deals with
						<br/>
               Email.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
						<br/>
               to see unvalidated files when looking through the file lists.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
						<br/>
               to download unvalidated files.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This setting defines the security level at which upload/
						<br/>
               download ratio checking is turned off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          P    This setting defines the security level at which the post/
						<br/>
               call ratio check is turned off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          R    This setting defines the security level at which file point
						<br/>
               checking is turned off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          S    This setting defines the security level at which uploaded
						<br/>
               files are automatically credited to the uploader.  (This is
						<br/>
               useful to prevent uploading of "garbage" files to balance an
						<br/>
               UL/DL ratio for further downloading.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          T    This setting defines the ACS needed to use MCI codes in the

						<br/>
						<br/>
          V    This setting defines the security level at which a user can

               send Netmail to another BBS on a network.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          W    This setting defines the security level at which a user can

						<br/>
               to the other nodes when they log on, and in the node listing

               that any single caller can make during a call.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    This option sets the limit for the amount of Email that can
						<br/>
               be kept waiting for a certain user.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    This option sets the limit for the amount of Email that can
						<br/>
               be kept waiting for a Co-SysOp.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    This option sets the number of logons a user can have before
						<br/>
               the BBS checks to see (as a security feature) if the user
						<br/>
               knows what the birthdate they entered into the BBS at the first
						<br/>
               logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    This option tells the BBS where to swap memory to when the
						<br/>
               BBS "swaps" out of Renegade. The locations are either (D)isk,
						<br/>
               (E)MS Memory, (X)MS Memory, (N)on XMS Extended Memory or
						<br/>
               (A)nywhere.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    This option sets the number of attempts a user can make to
						<br/>
               log on to the BBS, before the BBS hangs up on them.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This option sets the amount of days before a user has to
						<br/>
               change their password as a security precaution.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    This option sets the SysOp chat color.  This only matters
						<br/>
               to the users that can view ANSI colors, as this color is the
						<br/>
               one that is used while the SysOp is typing.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This goes along with option K, except that it's the user chat
						<br/>
               color.  (In case you're wondering.. the reason there are 2
						<br/>
               different colors for chat is basically so that the SysOp and
						<br/>
               user knows who said what.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This option sets the minimum amount of hard drive space (in K)
						<br/>
               that must be available on the hard drive in order to post a
						<br/>
               message.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    Pretty much the same as option M, except that it deals with the
						<br/>
               minimum amount of free space in order to upload. If less than
						<br/>
               this space is available, uploads will not be permitted.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This option sets the number of days that the SysOp back logs
						<br/>
               are kept.  (Maximum is 15 days.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          P    This option sets the time of inactivity before the WFC screen
						<br/>
               is blanked.  (Screen Saver)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          R    When a user pages the Sysop, and he doesn't answer, the PC
						<br/>
               speaker on his end will continue to emit a very irritating
						<br/>
               sound to let him know someone tried to page him. This option
						<br/>
               defines the number of seconds between the irritating noises.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          S    This option defines the number of calls the BBS has received.
						<br/>
               This number is automatically incremented each time a user
						<br/>
               remotely logs into the BBS.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          T    This option defines the minimum baud rate that can call into
						<br/>
               the BBS. (This is normally used to "lock-out" 300 baud users
						<br/>
               who are too slow to do much.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          U    This option defines the minimum baud rate that can download
						<br/>
               files from the BBS. (See note on option T)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          0-9  These are the F1-F10 SysOp Definable Macros that only the SysOp
						<br/>
               can use on the BBS. If the sysop presses F1 on the local
						<br/>
               keyboard, then what is defined as the F1 macro is what will
						<br/>
               be displayed.

     Enter selection (A-Z,1-3) [Q]uit :
						<br/>
     -------------------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
          A    This option specifies whether or not handles are allowed on
						<br/>
               the system.  (A handle is an alias.  Like CB Radio.) Some
						<br/>
               users like the anonymous aspect of BBSing, but it IS your
						<br/>
               choice.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          B    This option specifies whether or not the user's phone number
						<br/>
               is asked for during the logon process.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          C    This option controls local security protection. When Local
						<br/>
               Security Protection is turned on, the sysop password must be
						<br/>
               entered from the WFC screen in order to do anything (though
						<br/>
               the Q command still works from the WFC screen, regardless
						<br/>
               of whether or not Local Security Protection is on). Also,
						<br/>
               all passwords will be masked on the local display, as if it
						<br/>
               were remote. This is useful if the local computer is located in
						<br/>
               a place where many people might be passing near it. This not
						<br/>
               only protects your user data, but prevents others from possibly
						<br/>
               causing harm to your BBS. All told, if you're the only one
						<br/>
               that ever sits down in front of your computer, it's safe to
						<br/>
               leave this Off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          D    This option specifies whether or not the RENEGADE.OVR file
						<br/>
               is to be accessed from EMS (expanded) memory.  If the overlay
						<br/>
               can't be stored in EMS, Renegade will access the overlay from
						<br/>
               disk as usual. (Accessing the overlay via EMS is *much* faster
						<br/>
               than accessing it from disk.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
               NOTE: As of Renegade vXX-XXX, the overlay will load into
						<br/>
                     XMS if it is available. This can speed things up
						<br/>
                     and free up RAM if you unload your EMS driver.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    This option controls global activity trapping.  If set to
						<br/>
               On, it will log everything every user does to disk. 
						<br/>
               (Trust me, turn this off. The trap file will eat your hard
						<br/>
               drive space very quickly.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    This option specifies whether or not to automatically open
						<br/>
               the chat buffer during a chat session. If On, the entire
						<br/>
               conversation will be recorded in the CHAT.LOG in your
						<br/>
               LOGS directory. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    This option specifies whether or not the auto-message is
						<br/>
               displayed during the logon process.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    If this is On, and any Bulletins have been updated since
						<br/>
               the users last call, this will tell them which bulletins
						<br/>
               have been updated and ask if they'd like to see them. If
						<br/>
               it is turned off, nothing about bulletins will be said
						<br/>
               during login.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    This option specifies whether or not the user's status is
						<br/>
               shown during the logon process. If so, then it will read
						<br/>
               the YOURINFO.ASC present in your MISC directory. If the file
						<br/>
               does not exist, nothing will be displayed. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This option specifies whether or not Renegade's color
						<br/>
               codes will be stripped from the SysOp log.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    This option specifies whether or not the phone should be
						<br/>
               taken off-hook during local logons.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This option will toggle whether or not the messages going
						<br/>
               through teleconferencing should be logged or not.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This option controls the "compression" of file and message
						<br/>
               base numbers.  This option takes a little explaining...
						<br/>
						<br/>
               Say you have ten message bases (1-10), and bases 2, 6 and 9
						<br/>
               are restricted from certain users.  Normally when the list of
						<br/>
               message areas is displayed, those areas are not shown, leaving
						<br/>
               a gap in the listings (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10).  If this option
						<br/>
               is set to on, all the message base numbers are made contiguous
						<br/>
               (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) to the user. They user won't realize that
						<br/>
               they're restricted from seeing something.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    This option specifies whether or not ROM BIOS routines are
						<br/>
               to be used for all local screen output.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This option specifies whether or not IEMSI handshaking
						<br/>
               will take place or not.  IEMSI is simply when the user
						<br/>
               defines certain pieces of information in his terminal
						<br/>
               program such as Real Name, Address and such... it
						<br/>
               basically speeds up the logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          P    If this is on, then the BBS will not accept any new users.
						<br/>
               If it is off, they will be able to apply as normal.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          R    This option defines if Renegade will Swap memory if it shells
						<br/>
               out of the BBS. Renegade tends to default this to Off when
						<br/>
               installed. Trust me, turn it on. :)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          S    This option defines if the BBS will use the Shuttle Logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          T    This option toggles Chat call paging. (After a user pages you,
						<br/>
               the board buzzes you to remind you that the user wants to chat.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          U    This option defines if the time limits are per call or per
						<br/>
               day.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          V    This option defines if most options (some are logon, most
						<br/>
               functions in SysOp menu, etc.) ask for the SysOp password
						<br/>
               before letting you execute the command.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          W    Toggles a random quote in the logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          X    Allows the user to add to the random quotes that are displayed
						<br/>
               at logon.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          Y    Toggles (default) to use lightbars for the message area listings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          Z    Toggles (default) to use lightbars for the file area listings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          1    This option defines the number of the user that will receive
						<br/>
               "new user" messages.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               NOTE: If you do not wish to have a new user message sent to
						<br/>
                     anyone, select [D]isable.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          2    This option specifies the number of minutes before the bell
						<br/>
               is sounded to alert the user that the system is about to
						<br/>
               "time out".
						<br/>
						<br/>
                NOTE: If you do not wish this to go into effect, select
						<br/>
                      [D]isable
						<br/>
						<br/>
          3    This option specifies the number of minutes that are allowed
						<br/>
               to pass with no activity before the system "times out".
						<br/>
						<br/>
                NOTE: If you do not wish this to go into effect, select
						<br/>
                      [D]isable

     Enter selection (A-O) [Q]uit :
						<br/>
     ---------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
          A    This option specifies whether or not upload/download ratio
						<br/>
               checking is active.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          B    This option specifies whether or not a file point file system
						<br/>
               is active.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          C    This option turns the daily download limits on or off.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          D    This option toggles if the uploads will be recommented and
						<br/>
               converted to the current file base's archive setting.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    This command works with option H. If this is turned on, the user
						<br/>
               will receive the percentage defined in H of the files file point
						<br/>
               worth everytime the file is downloaded.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    This option will toggle whether or not Renegade will search an
						<br/>
               uploaded file for FILE-ID.DIZ.  (It is a file that describes
						<br/>
               what the file is, no matter what the user enters for
						<br/>
               information.  It is a standard also used by PC Board.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    This option will toggle whether or not Renegade will
						<br/>
               recompress archives when the file is uploaded. (Helpful to
						<br/>
               force Maximum Compression, add a AV stamp, etc.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    This option defines the % of the file's points that is
						<br/>
               rewarded to the uploader whenever the file is downloaded.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    This option defines how many points the user gets per file
						<br/>
               credits they've earned. ie, with the setting above, if a user
						<br/>
               uploaded a file worth 1 file point, they would receive 4.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This option defines what 1 file point is equal to in K.
						<br/>
               (ie: if set to 10k, every 10k of a file will charge the user
						<br/>
               1 file point.)
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    This option defines the percentage of time that a user is
						<br/>
               refunded after uploading a file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    This option defines the file base that is set to "SysOp only".
						<br/>
               This is for SysOp-only uploads which are sent by putting a "\"
						<br/>
               as the first character in the file description.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    This option specifies whether or not all uploaded files are
						<br/>
               to be auto-validated.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    This option defines the maximum number of kilobytes allowed
						<br/>
               in the temporary archive working directory.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    This option defines the minimum number of kilobytes that

               must have been sent during an upload before it can be saved
						<br/>
               for a resume-later upload operation.

  Chapter 6-I: Offline Mail Configuration
						<br/>
  --------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     Offline Mail is a system where one computer takes messages, compresses
						<br/>
     it to a file, then you transfer it to the other computer, and it is
						<br/>
     processed.  This saves time online for other people to call, and to
						<br/>
     cut down on any phone charges.
						<br/>
     ------------------------

     Enter selection (A-I) [Q]uit :
						<br/>
     -------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
        A       This option is what the name of the QWK packet which is
						<br/>
                created will be called (and what the reply is called.) without
						<br/>
                the QWK or REP extension.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        B       This option is the complete path and filename (without
						<br/>
                extension) of the welcome screen in the QWK file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        C       This option is the complete path and filename (without
						<br/>
                extension) of the news file in the QWK file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
                (Note: Renegade does *not* generate a news file; you
						<br/>
                 must either create it yourself, or via third party
						<br/>
                 utility)
						<br/>
						<br/>
        D       This option is the complete path and filename (without
						<br/>
                extension) of the goodbye file in the QWK file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        E       This option is the complete path to where you normally
						<br/>
                have your QWK files and REP files for when you want to read
						<br/>
                the BBS's messages offline with the other mail packets.
						<br/>
                If the file *.QWK already exists, the new packet will be
						<br/>
                renamed to *.QWA, then *.QWB, then *.QWC up to *.QWZ.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        F       This option can be set if you want people to have unlimited
						<br/>
                time for downloading their mail (no matter what the time they
						<br/>
                have left, let them d/l their mail packet).
						<br/>

                messages per message base.
						<br/>
						<br/>
        I       This option will set the ACS needed to upload Network Reply

  Chapter 6-*: String Configuration
						<br/>
  -----------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
    String config is where the customizable prompts, quotes, questions and
						<br/>
    text are located.
						<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
  Chapter 6-*-1:
						<br/>
  -----------
						<br/>
						<br/>
--------------------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
Logon Quote Strings:  These are located in your \RENEGADE\TEXT directory
						<br/>
in the LGNQUOTE.TXT file.   Each quote is seperated via a $.   The logon
						<br/>
quotes must be compiled after any changes for it to take efferct.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
LGNQUOTE example:
						<br/>
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
It takes a big man to cry, but it takes a bigger man to
						<br/>
laugh at that man.
						<br/>
$

						<br/>
$
						<br/>
If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp,
						<br/>
because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try
						<br/>
to catch you, because, hey, free dummy.
						<br/>
$
						<br/>
						<br/>
Run LGNQUOTE.EXE to compile these strings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
Renegade now gives you the option to add a tagline to your email
						<br/>
and messages.  The format is as follows.   One message per line
						<br/>
in the file TAGLINE.TXT.  
						<br/>
						<br/>
All's well that ends well - E. A. Poe
						<br/>
All's well that ends well. -Poe.    Bother. -Pooh.
						<br/>
Always avoid the inevitable
						<br/>
Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it.
						<br/>
Always be smarter than the people who hire you.
						<br/>
Always remember where you came from so you can return.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
Run TAGLINE.EXE to compile any new taglines so they can be used.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						<br/>
A bunch of strings that were previously uneditable in Renegade has
						<br/>
been slowly removed to RGLNG.TXT.
						<br/>
						<br/>
RGLNG.TXT is your main file for most strings.
						<br/>
						<br/>
example:
						<br/>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<br/>
          1-3:Archive comments - Allows the definition of up to three
						<br/>
               different archive comments, which can be added to archive
						<br/>
               files automatically after they have been uploaded.
						<br/>

     Edit menu: (1-8,[,],Q) :
						<br/>
     ----------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     The "["  and "]" keys will allow you to move back and forth between
						<br/>
     each entry in the list.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          1    This option specifies whether or not the archive format is
						<br/>
               active.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          2    This option specifies the extension used for files saved in
						<br/>
               the particular archive format.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          3    This option defines the way the board is to view the contents
						<br/>
               of archive files in the current format.
						<br/>
						<br/>
                    /1 - Uses the internal ZIP file viewer
						<br/>
                    /2 - Uses the internal ARC file viewer
						<br/>
                    /3 - Uses the internal ZOO file viewer
						<br/>
                    /4 - Uses the internal LZH file viewer
						<br/>
                    /5 - Uses the internal ARJ file viewer
						<br/>
						<br/>
               If you have defined an archive format that is not supported
						<br/>
               internally, use this option to define the Commandline required
						<br/>
               to view the archive's contents.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          4    This option defines the command line used to create or
						<br/>
               update an archive file using this format.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               If this line is blank, Renegade assumes the file is compressed.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               This is for people who want to test things such as GIF files,
						<br/>
               while leaving the Recompress Archive flag on.  Before, files
						<br/>
               would be deleted because they could not be compressed.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          5    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines
						<br/>
               the Commandline used to extract files from an archive file.
						<br/>
               All rules and restrictions mentioned above also apply.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          6    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines the
						<br/>
               Commandline needed to check the integrity of an archive file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          7    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines the
						<br/>
               Commandline used to add a comment to an archive file.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          8    This option defines the ERRORLEVEL value that the archiving
						<br/>
               program returns when an operation has been successfully
						<br/>
               completed.  Most programs return a level of 0.

     -----------------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
          (S)et - Sets the SL values for a range of SL areas.  You are
						<br/>
               asked to enter the starting and ending SL areas, and the
						<br/>
               new value to be placed in those spots.

               and 160-255.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          (Q)uit - Returns you to the System Configuration menu.

  Chapter 6-O: Call Allowances Per Day
						<br/>
  ------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of calls allowed per day.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  ------------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-P: UL/DL # of Files Ratio
						<br/>
  ------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of files that a user can download for every file that they
						<br/>
     upload.  If set to 0, this function becomes disabled for that SL.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  -----------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-Q: UL/DL KiloBytes Ratio
						<br/>
  -----------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of K that a user can download for every K that they
						<br/>
     upload.  If set to 0, this function becomes disabled for that SL.
						<br/>
						<br/>
  --------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-R: Post/Call Ratio
						<br/>
  --------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
						<br/>
     sets the number of posts per call ratio that must be kept in order to have
						<br/>
     a correct PCR. (Helpful if you want to keep people out of the File transfer
						<br/>
     section until they get productive in posting, etc..)
						<br/>
						<br/>
  Some people have gotten confused about this section.  You want to enter the
						<br/>
  number of posts that a user of that Security Level (SL) would need for the ACS
						<br/>
  "ZZ", per 100 calls.  (ie: if this was set to 25, the user would have to post
						<br/>
  25 messages for every 100 calls they make.  if they don't, they won't have ACS
						<br/>
  "ZZ", and therefore can't do anything that you have "ZZ" in.)

						<br/>
						<br/>
  ---------------
						<br/>
  Chapter 6-T: Max D/L K Per Day

----------------------------------------
						<br/>
						<br/>
          A    Alters the user's name.  If the BBS allows handles, this
						<br/>
               name can be set differently from the user's real name.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          B    Alters the user's real name.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          C    Alters the user's address.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          D    Alters the user's city and state/province.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          E    Alters the user's postal zip code.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          F    Alters the comment field if you want to be reminded of something
						<br/>
               about the user.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          G    Alters the user's answer to the 1st SysOp Definable Question.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          H    Alters the user's answer to the 2nd SysOp Definable Question.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          I    Alters the user's answer to the 3rd SysOp Definable Question.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          J    This command toggles the Status of the user:
						<br/>
                1) This command can be set to record every action of a
						<br/>
                   user from logon to logoff.
						<br/>
                2) This command is used to turn auto-chat buffering on.
						<br/>
                3) This command will output the users actions to a separate
						<br/>
                   SysOp log specific to the user.
						<br/>
                4) This command will alert the SysOp when the user logs on
						<br/>
                   the next time.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               The Display next to Status doesn't display the status of
						<br/>
               Chat buffer or SysOp Log, but notifies you if the user is
						<br/>
               Deleted or if they are locked out.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          K    Alters the configuration of the user's QWK packets.
						<br/>
						<br/>
          L    Alters the user's security level (SL).
						<br/>
						<br/>
          M    Alters the user's download security level (DSL).
						<br/>
						<br/>
          N    Allows toggling of the user's AR flags.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               NOTE: AR Flags can get complicated. Unlike AC Flags,
						<br/>
                     AR Flags are *not* predefined, you as the sysop
						<br/>
                     can use them for whatever you please. This is
						<br/>
                     done by ACS checking (see the Fx ACS level in
						<br/>
                     Chapter 3). For example, if I want to set access
						<br/>
                     to my file menu to users only with AR Flag F, I
						<br/>
                     change the access on the file menu via the menu
						<br/>
                     editor to read "FF" (without the quotation marks).
						<br/>
                     After doing this, if a user tries access the file
						<br/>
                     menu, and they do not have AR flag F toggled on, then
						<br/>
                     they will be denied access to the menu. If they do
						<br/>
                     have AR Flag F toggled on, they'll be allowed to access
						<br/>
                     the menu. In this manner, a sysop could pick and choose
						<br/>
                     who has access to the file menu simply by toggling that
						<br/>
                     users flags. 
						<br/>
						<br/>
          O    Allows toggling of the user's AC flags.
						<br/>
						<br/>
            AC Flag Definitions:
						<br/>
						<br/>
               Penalty Flags -
						<br/>
						<br/>
               L    Can logon ONLY once/day - Does not allow a given
						<br/>
                    caller to have more than one BBS logon in a given
						<br/>
                    day.
						<br/>
						<br/>
               C    Can't page SysOp - Does not allow the caller to use
						<br/>
                    the chat command throughout the BBS.
						<br/>
						<br/>

							<br/>
               Batch or Single Download) will be copied to the BBS Temporary
							<br/>
               Directory under the CD directory.  They are automatically

               area listing regardless of whether or not the user has access
							<br/>
               to that base. If the user lacks access, it will show in the

  Chapter 8-A: Configuring CD-ROM File Areas
							<br/>
  ---------------------
							<br/>
							<br/>
   CD-ROM areas are pretty easy to configure under RG. CD's are a
							<br/>
   nice addition to any BBS. They hold over half a gig of files, and
							<br/>
   unless you play frisbee with them, leave them under heat lamps, or
							<br/>
   practice other destructive little habits, the media will probably
							<br/>
   outlive you. :)
							<br/>
							<br/>
   NOTE: This section will assume that any CD you're adding will have
							<br/>
   all the files in one directory. If the CD you wish to add has more
							<br/>
   than one directory of files on it, repeat these steps for each directory
							<br/>
   on on the CD.
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Adding a CD to your BBS begins by creating a filebase for it. Make sure
							<br/>
   the Download Path is pointing to the CD drive and the directory the
							<br/>
   files are in (ie, if your CD-ROM is drive F: and the files are in BURN,
							<br/>
   set the path to F:\BURN)
							<br/>
							<br/>
   As for the upload path, you have a choice to make. Obviously, you can't
							<br/>
   upload files to the CD. You can still upload files to that filebase,
							<br/>
   they'll be stored in the UL path that you define. If you don't intend
							<br/>
   on storing any files beyond what's already on the CD, then set the UL
							<br/>
   path to the same as the DL path.

   Press C to turn the CD-ROM flag on for the area. This is important;
							<br/>
   by turning the C flag on you're telling Renegade to copy the files off
							<br/>
   the CD and onto the local harddisk before transferring them to a
							<br/>
   remote system. I recommend this; downloading from a CD is *slow*, and
							<br/>
   if you're using a disc changer, you really do not want to the discs
							<br/>
   to change in the middle of someones download. :)
							<br/>
							<br/>
   It should look something like this:
							<br/>
							<br/>
         --------------------
							<br/>
         1. Name        : CD #1 [Online] - Renegade Source Code
							<br/>
         2. Filename    : CDROM1
							<br/>
         3. DL/UL path  : E:\RGSRC\ / E:\RGSRC\
							<br/>
         4. ACS req'd   : s50
							<br/>
         5. UL/DL ACS   :  /
							<br/>
         6. Max files   : 2000
							<br/>
         7. Password    :
							<br/>
         8. Arc/cmt type: ZIP/1
							<br/>
            Flags       : --C-
							<br/>
         --------------------
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Next, put the CD into the drive, login, head to your file menu, change
							<br/>
   to the new filebase, and locally upload the files.
							<br/>
							<br/>
   Yes, this is slow. Yes, this is a pain in the ass. Yes, this can consume
							<br/>
   most of your afternoon before you realize it. Pray and hope that the files
							<br/>
   on the CD have FILE_ID.DIZ's or DESC.SDI's, otherwise you have to enter
							<br/>
   the descriptions by hand.
							<br/>
							<br/>
   There is an alternative. If there is a file named FILES.BBS anywhere on
							<br/>
   the CD, you can save yourself alot of pain and trouble. The FILES.BBS
							<br/>
   *should* contain the file descriptions for the files on the CD.

								<br/>
          3    Designates the message base type.  Three types are currently
								<br/>
               available:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    Local - Allows the exchange of messages only between
								<br/>
                         the users of the BBS.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    Echomail - Allows the exchange of messages, via a FidoNet
								<br/>
                         type message network system.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    QWKMail - Adds origin lines and tear lines to messages,
								<br/>
                         but does not export or add addresses.  This is for
								<br/>
                         use with the QWK Networking feature.
								<br/>
								<br/>
               When a base is defined as Echomail, you will be prompted for a
								<br/>
               disk drive message path.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          4    The ACS requirements that the user must meet in order to
								<br/>
               access the message base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          5    The user must have this ACS setting in order to post messages on
								<br/>
               this base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          6    This is the ACS setting for users to have "SysOp Commands"
								<br/>
               available to them.  This is helpful for BBS moderators.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          7    This is the maximum number of messages that can be posted on
								<br/>
               the base. (Default is 100.) When the number of messages exceeds
								<br/>
               this limit old posts start getting removed when the base gets
								<br/>
               packed.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          8    This determines the anonymity level of the message base.
								<br/>
               Available anonymity levels are:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (Y)es, anonymous allowed.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (N)o, anonymous not allowed.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (F)orced Anonymous - This automatically makes every
								<br/>
                         post on the base anonymous.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (D)ear Abby - This is for a "Dear Abby" problem
								<br/>
                         solving message base.  A user may post a message
								<br/>
                         under ANY one of these three possibilities:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                              "Problemed User" - Posted by a user who
								<br/>
                                   wants help, but wishes to remain anonymous.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                              "Abby" - Allows another user to respond to a
								<br/>
                                   problem post, with anonymity.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                              User name and number - Allows a caller to
								<br/>
                                   post a problem/suggestion under their
								<br/>
                                   handle and user number.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    (A)ny Name - Allows users to post messages using any name
								<br/>
                                   they like.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          9    When active, this will prompt a user for the password which
								<br/>
               must be entered correctly in order to access that message base.

          C    Defines the colors used for standard text, quoted text,
								<br/>
               tear, and origin lines for Echomail and Groupmail messages.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          M    Defines the various flag settings used when tossing,
								<br/>
               scanning, and posting Echomail and Groupmail messages.  The
								<br/>
               currently available flags are:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                    K - Strip IFNA kludge lines.
								<br/>
                    S - Strip SEEN-BY lines (Echomail only).
								<br/>
                    O - Strip origin lines.
								<br/>
                    T - Add tear and origin lines to posted messages.
								<br/>
                    I - Sets the message base to Internet Status
								<br/>
								<br/>
          O    Defines the origin line placed at the bottom of Echomail and
								<br/>
               Groupmail messages.

								<br/>
          T    Allows you to edit the base's flag set.  
								<br/>
								<br/>
               Flag Definitions:
								<br/>
								<br/>
                R   Real Names Flag: If active, real names are stored in the
								<br/>
                    "From:" and "To:" fields of each message.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                U   Unhidden Flag: If active, it will display a message base
								<br/>
                    in an area listing regardless if the user has access to
								<br/>
                    that base. If the user does not have access to the base,
								<br/>
                    the name of the base will be shown without a base number.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                A   Strip 8-bit ASCII/ANSI Flag: If active, ANSI codes and
								<br/>
                    8-bit ASCII characters (127-255) are removed from messages
								<br/>
                    before they are posted.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                P   Private Messages Flag: If active, this allows private
								<br/>
                    posts to be allowed in the message base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                     NOTE: If a Private message is posted within an echomail
								<br/>
                           base, it will still be sent out with the rest of
								<br/>
                           the mail. The Private flag affects local status
								<br/>
                           only.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                F   Forced Flag: If active, this will disable the Q command,
								<br/>
                    making the base a "Mandatory Reading" base to read every
								<br/>
                    message.
								<br/>
								<br/>
                Q   Add a tagline to end of message in this base.
								<br/>
								<br/>
          P    Defines the QWK packet conference that this base is permanently
								<br/>
               assigned.  Normally when created, this will be equal to the
								<br/>
               base number.  If a base below this one is deleted however, the
								<br/>
               QWK replies will always be brought into this conference because
								<br/>
               of the permanent number.

          2    This option defines the ACS requirements that the user must have
																<br/>
               to use the protocol.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          3    This option defines the name of the file that holds the
																<br/>
               result log of a file transfer operation.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          4    This option defines the names of the permanent result log
																<br/>
               files for upload and download transfers.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          5    This option defines the commands required to perform file
																<br/>
               uploading and downloading.
																<br/>
																<br/>
               When pressed, you will be asked which command (upload or
																<br/>
               download) to define.  You are then asked which type of command
																<br/>
               it will be.  The four different command types are as follows:
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    (C)ommand - The entry is assigned to a special
																<br/>
                         function.
																<br/>
                         Ascii - The selected file will be transferred to
																<br/>
                              the remote user via ASCII transfer.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Batch - The entry will not actually transfer a
																<br/>
                              file, but instead will add the file to the
																<br/>
                              batch transfer queue.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Edit - The selected file's directory entry is edited
																<br/>
                              and the information can be changed.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Next - The selected file is skipped and the next
																<br/>
                              file is selected.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                         Quit - The selection is cancelled.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    (E)xternal - Allows you to define the actual DOS
																<br/>
                         Commandline used with the protocol driver.  Refer to
																<br/>
                         the above list to determine the correct Commandline.
																<br/>
																<br/>
                    (O)ff - Disables that particular function for the
																<br/>
                         protocol.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          6    This option toggles if the error result codes defined in option
																<br/>
               7 mean a good or bad transfer.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          7    This option defines the result codes (for both uploading and
																<br/>
               downloading) returned by the protocol driver after completing
																<br/>
               transmission of a file.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          E    This option defines the command that sets up an environment
																<br/>
               string for those programs that require environment variables to
																<br/>
               be set up in certain ways for a transfer log.  For example:
																<br/>
               "SET DSZLOG=%T" would set the DSZ.COM temporary result log
																<br/>
               filename to the name defined in option 3.  If no environment
																<br/>
               setup is necessary, this string should be set to NULL ("").
																<br/>
																<br/>
               *IMPORTANT*:   If you define a command with this option, make
																<br/>
                              sure to define it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE!
																<br/>
																<br/>
          I    This option defines the name of the file in which Renegade
																<br/>
               will store the filenames to be transferred in a batch
																<br/>
               transfer.
																<br/>
																<br/>
          C    This option defines the maximum number of characters allowed
																<br/>
               on the DOS Commandline.  (Default is 128, which is the normal
																<br/>
               allowable DOS size.)
																<br/>
																<br/>
          P    This option defines the positions, on a single line of the
																<br/>
               temporary result log, of the filename and return status of the
																<br/>
               transfer.

																	<br/>
																	<br/>
               (Most people use the @V MCI command to insert a
																	<br/>
                HH:MM:SS type format time left string in their
																	<br/>
                menu-prompt.)

  Chapter 11-B: Linking Menu Commands
																	<br/>
  ------------------
																	<br/>
																	<br/>
     When a user activates a menu command, Renegade executes all of the
																	<br/>
     commands which have the command letters which were entered by the user.
																	<br/>
     If two different commands both have the same command letters in them,
																	<br/>
     both commands are executed in the order they are in the menu.
																	<br/>
																	<br/>
     When linking commands together, remember to put a description only on
																	<br/>
     the first command in the link, and set the rest to null.  This stops
																	<br/>
     Renegade from displaying the command several times on the generic menu.
																	<br/>
																	<br/>

																	<br/>
  Chapter 11-C: Menu System Commands (Command Keys)
																	<br/>
  -------------------------
																	<br/>
																	<br/>
     The Command Key (CmdKey)'s are 2 letter codes which make Renegade do a
																	<br/>
     certain function. (<> means Optional, [] means required, {} means pick
																	<br/>
     one. None means there is no Option available for that command.)

          !    This determines whether or not the event is active.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          1    This describes the event.  (Up to 80 characters)
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          2    This is the type of event that will be executed.  There are
																																																																<br/>
               six choices:
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    ACS - Enables only certain callers who have the correct
																																																																<br/>
                         security settings to access the BBS at a certain time
																																																																<br/>
                         of the day.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Chat - Not implemented yet.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    DOS - Shells to the DOS level and executes files defined
																																																																<br/>
                           in the Event Data.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    External - This requires a batch file for execution, which
																																																																<br/>
                         is used to detect an ERRORLEVEL value.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Pack - This event packs the message bases by removing
																																																																<br/>
                         all deleted messages and adjusting the number of
																																																																<br/>
                         messages in each base to conform to the maximum
																																																																<br/>
                         limit set in the message base editor.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Sort - This event sorts the file bases by scanning the
																																																																<br/>
                         directories and sorting by name.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          3    This field will vary with the type of event being executed.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    DOS - The name of the program to be run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    External - The ERRORLEVEL value to be used when the BBS
																																																																<br/>
                         quits to DOS.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    ACS - The ACS setting that users must have.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    All others - Not used; the event data field will be
																																																																<br/>
                         ignored.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          4    This is the time before an event that the BBS will become busy.
																																																																<br/>
               If a user is online, their online time is adjusted for the
																																																																<br/>
               event.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          5    This is the time of day that the particular scheduled event
																																																																<br/>
               will occur.  It is defined in the 24-hour format.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          6    This field determines whether or not the modem will be made
																																																																<br/>
               busy during the scheduled event.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          7    This tells if the event is "Hard" or "Soft".  Hard events
																																																																<br/>
               will make Renegade shorten a user's time online if it will
																																																																<br/>
               keep them on longer then when the event will run.  Soft events
																																																																<br/>
               wait for the user to logoff before the event is run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          8    This field determines if the BBS should run the event if it
																																																																<br/>
               missed it the last time it was supposed to be run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          9    This field sets the number of days since the event was last
																																																																<br/>
               run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          A    These are the days of either the regular week, or the month,
																																																																<br/>
               that the scheduled event will occur.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Weekly - Event will occur at least once every week.  A
																																																																<br/>
                    bar with the current days active will be displayed as
																																																																<br/>
                    follows:
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                              Current: SMTWTFS
																																																																<br/>
                                      [       ]
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Modify by entering "X"'s under the days the event is to be
																																																																<br/>
                    active.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
                    Monthly - This will occur only one day in the month, and
																																																																<br/>
                            is modified by entering the day it is to be run.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          B    This field determines which node will run the event.  0 means
																																																																<br/>
               the first free node will run it.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          [    This will jump back one entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          ]    This will move forward one entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          F    This will move to the first entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          L    This will move to the last entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          J    This will jump to a specified entry in the list of events.
																																																																<br/>
																																																																<br/>
          Q    Saves all entries in the list of events and returns to the
																																																																<br/>
               main editor screen.

        Mini-DOS is a small, compact version of the DOS Commandline.  When

        you enter this area, you will see something like:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
          E:\RENEGADE>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
        where E:\RENEGADE is your BBS Home directory.  The commands available

        here are:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         CD            Normal DOS Change Directory Command
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         CLS           Normal DOS Clear Screen Command
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         CONVERT       This command will convert an archived file to another
																																																																				<br/>
                       archive format.  The proper format for the command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       CONVERT FILENAME.EXT XTN
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       where FILENAME.EXT is the full drive:\path\filename
																																																																				<br/>
                       with the correct archive extension of the archive you
																																																																				<br/>
                       want to convert (ie: RENEGADE.ZIP).  XTN is the archive
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension that you want to convert the original file to

                       (ie: ARJ). The archive type you want to convert to
																																																																				<br/>
                       must be defined in the Archive Configuration.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         COPY          Normal DOS Copy Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DEL           Normal DOS Delete Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DIR           This command will provide a short DOS directory.  The
																																																																				<br/>
                        use is the same as the normal DOS Directory Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DIRSIZE       This command will provide the amount of space that a
																																																																				<br/>
                       given filetype takes up.  The usage is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         DIRSIZE FILETYPE[.EXT]
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       FILETYPE is a valid DOS filename, EXT is an optional
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension.  Wildcards are allowed.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       "DIRSIZE *.ZIP" shows the total size of all the ZIP
																																																																				<br/>
                       files, while "DIRSIZE *" will show the total size of
																																																																				<br/>
                       all the files that don't have an extension.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         DISKFREE      This command will show the amount of space free on the
																																																																				<br/>
                       current drive.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         EDIT          This command will pop up the old Renegade Editor, which
																																																																				<br/>
                       is not unlike the DOS command EDLIN.  If no file is
																																																																				<br/>
                       specified, the file is then asked for.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         EXT           This command will allow the command after it (ie:
																																																																				<br/>
                       EXT DIR) to pass to DOS directly, not relying on
																																																																				<br/>
                       MiniDOS. Be very careful of who has access to MiniDOS.
																																																																				<br/>
                       Anyone can use this command to format your harddrive,
																																																																				<br/>
                       deltree your root directory, or run a virus they've
																																																																				<br/>
                       just uploaded.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         EXIT          Normal DOS EXIT Command which will return you to
																																																																				<br/>
                       Renegade.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         HELP or ?     This command will up the DOSHELP.* file as a Help
																																																																				<br/>
                       me file.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         MD            Normal DOS Make Directory Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         MOVE          This command will copy a file or a group of files
																																																																				<br/>
                       and then will delete the original files.  The proper
																																																																				<br/>
                       format for this command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         MOVE FILESPEC.EXT DESTINATION
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         RD            Normal DOS Remove Directory Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         RECEIVE       This command will tell Renegade to receive a file from
																																																																				<br/>
                       the remote computer.  The full command is just
																																																																				<br/>
                       "RECEIVE".  After pressing enter, Renegade will prompt
																																																																				<br/>
                       for a protocol, and if the protocol is a non-batch
																																																																				<br/>
                       protocol, Renegade will prompt for a filename.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         REN           Normal DOS Rename File Command.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         SEND          This command is the opposite of receive, as it will
																																																																				<br/>
                       allow the remote computer to receive a file that is
																																																																				<br/>
                       sent from Renegade.  No filespecs are required for the
																																																																				<br/>
                       command.  The filename is asked for and then the
																																																																				<br/>
                       protocol.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         TYPE          Normal DOS Type Command. (If in Renegade, you have a
																																																																				<br/>
                       page pause, the file you are typing will be paused.)
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         UNZIP         This command will extract the files from an archive
																																																																				<br/>
                       file (Not just ZIP files, any archive type defined in
																																																																				<br/>
                       the Archive Configuration can be extracted with this
																																																																				<br/>
                       command). The proper format for this command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         UNZIP FILENAME.EXT [OPTIONAL]
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       FILENAME.EXE is the FULL path and filename with
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension of the archive.  [OPTIONAL] is any optional
																																																																				<br/>
                       information that should be passed to the Un-Archiver,
																																																																				<br/>
                       such as destination, file to extract, etc. 
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         VER           This command will just notify you that you are in the
																																																																				<br/>
                       Renegade DOS Emulator.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         VIEW         This command will use the Renegade Internal File lister
																																																																				<br/>
                      and will list the files inside an archive.  The proper
																																																																				<br/>
                      use for this command is:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                        INF FILENAME
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                      VIEW will search for wildcards for the extension. In
																																																																				<br/>
                      order to see an archives interior with VIEW, that
																																																																				<br/>
                      archive type must have been defined in the Archive
																																																																				<br/>
                      Configuration.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                      NOTE: The default DOSHELP.ASC 
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
         ZIP           This command is the opposite of the UNZIP command.  It
																																																																				<br/>
                       has the same format however:
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                         ZIP FILENAME.EXT FILE1.EXT [FILE2.EXT ...]
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
                       FILENAME.EXT is the full path and filename with
																																																																				<br/>
                       extension, FILE1.EXT is the full path and filename
																																																																				<br/>
                       for the first file to be archived.  [FILE2.EXT ...]
																																																																				<br/>
                       is any other files you want to stick in the archive.
																																																																				<br/>
                       The archive type you're compressing to must be defined
																																																																				<br/>
                       in the Archive Configuration.
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<br/>
																																																																				<X>:          
																																																																					<X> = Drive Letter: Normal DOS Change Drive command.
																																																																						<br/>
                       ie - C: changes to the C drive, D: to the drive, and so
																																																																						<br/>
                       on.

  Chapter 16-A: How They're Made
																																																																						<br/>
  ---------------
																																																																						<br/>
																																																																						<br/>
     Infoform questionnaires are text files with certain commands that only
																																																																						<br/>
     have meaning to the BBS.  The questionnaire is stored in the MISC
																																																																						<br/>
     directory, in a file with the extension .INF, .INA or .INV (No Emulation,
																																																																						<br/>
     ANSI Emulation, or Avatar Emulation, respectively.)  When users answer
																																																																						<br/>
     the question(s), their answers are also stored in the MISC directory, in
																																																																						<br/>
     a file with the extension ".ASW".  Answers from other users are appended
																																																																						<br/>
     to the end of the answer file.

Alright!  Only a few more questions to go before you can logon.  Please

answer the questions, as they are essential for Validation and just as a
																																																																						<br/>
security measure.  Don't worry though....  It's not a test. (it's a quiz..)

     Below are listed all the Infoform questionnaire commands currently
																																																																						<br/>
     supported by Renegade.  All commands must start on a separate line,
																																																																						<br/>
     beginning with a ";" character.  Labels also start on a separate line,
																																																																						<br/>
     but beginning with a ":" character, and are followed by a string of
																																																																						<br/>
     characters which define the label name.  Everything else is treated as
																																																																						<br/>
     straight text.  A ";

---------------------------------------</b>
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     Certain errors while Renegade is online cause it to exit back to DOS.
																																																																																																			<br/>
     Whenever this occurs, the screen image is sent to a file called
																																																																																																			<br/>
     ERROR.LOG in your main BBS directory, along with certain pieces of
																																																																																																			<br/>
     information such as the time, date, error number, BBS version, the user
																																																																																																			<br/>
     who was on and what baud rate they were on at.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     A message is also sent to the SysOp log, and the user's screen when a
																																																																																																			<br/>
     error occurs.  If a error does occur in Renegade, please report it to
																																																																																																			<br/>
     either your local support hub, or one of the Renegade Alpha sites.  Please
																																																																																																			<br/>
     send along the information at the top of the section where the error is in
																																																																																																			<br/>
     the ERROR.LOG file.

																																																																																																			<br/>
                v5-11 Exp, the OY command key has been removed. Copy the
																																																																																																			<br/>
                YOURINFO.ASC included in this archive to your MISC directory
																																																																																																			<br/>
                and change OY to -F in all your menus, and change #6. Options

																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     Renegade looks for certain extensions when displaying files out of the
																																																																																																			<br/>
MISC directory. Which file is displayed depends on the extension (.xxx) and
																																																																																																			<br/>
the users emulation. The extensions are defined as follows:
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     ASC - This generally denotes a plain text file. It can contain color
																																																																																																			<br/>
           codes which are displayed to users in any emulation mode.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     ANS - This denotes a file saved in ANSI and will be displayed to users
																																																																																																			<br/>
           who have ANSI emulation or above.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 AN1-AN9 - If a file with the extension of .AN1 exists, Renegade will
																																																																																																			<br/>
           pick and display a random file. For example; During the logon
																																																																																																			<br/>
           sequence, WELCOME.ANS is displayed. If WELCOME.AN1 exists,
																																																																																																			<br/>
           Renegade will randomnly choose which file file to display.
																																																																																																			<br/>
           This can go on from AN1 to AN9, allowing you to define up to
																																																																																																			<br/>
           ten files (ANS counts as well) of which Renegade will choose
																																																																																																			<br/>
           and display one of them.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 A0S-A6S - These files are displayed on different days of the week, ranging
																																																																																																			<br/>
           from 0:Sunday to 6:Saturday.They can be used in conjunction with the
																																																																																																			<br/>
           random files, too. (WELCOME.A01 for example, means the first (1)
																																																																																																			<br/>
           random ANSI displayed on Sundays).
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     AVT - This denotes a file saved in Avatar, and will be displayed to
																																																																																																			<br/>
           users who have Avatar emulation or above. If a user selects Avatar
																																																																																																			<br/>
           as their emulation, and no .AVT files exist, Renegade will fall
																																																																																																			<br/>
           back and display ANSI files instead. If no .ANS files are found,
																																																																																																			<br/>
           it will fall back to .ASC.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 AV1-AV9 - Avatar follows the same guidelines for random files that ANSI
																																																																																																			<br/>
           does, only with AV1-AV9 as the valid extensions.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
     RIP - This extension denotes a file saved in RIP format (see Glossary
																																																																																																			<br/>
           of Terms). RIP files are forced to display, even in expert
																																																																																																			<br/>
           mode. If a user selects RIP as their emulation, and no .RIP
																																																																																																			<br/>
           files exist, it will fall back to Avatar, then Ansi, and then
																																																																																																			<br/>
           to .ASC if necessary.
																																																																																																			<br/>
																																																																																																			<br/>
 RI1-RI9 - RIP follows the same guidelines for random files that ANSI
																																																																																																			<br/>
           does, only with RI1-RI9 as the valid extensions.

 Chapter 20 - Teleconference<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------------------</b>
<br/>
Teleconference Notes: All of the commands in this section that have username<br/>
options (like /MSG, /EJECT, etc.) can have partial usernames. Ex: /PRIVATE Adr<br/>
will send a private message to an online user with A,d, and r as the first<br/>
part of their handle.<br/><br/>
As of v98-101b, the Teleconference commands changed in syntax. They've been<br/>
expanded from their former single letter commands (/P to /PRIVATE for example).<br/>
The WHATSNEW wasn't entirely correct in the listed changes for Teleconference.<br/>
The following mistakes were made in the WHATSNEW regarding the changes to<br/>
Teleconferencing:<br/><br/>
A) The maximum number of global channels is erroneously reported as 255.<br/>
The true maximum number is 32767.<br/><br/>
B) The /REGISTRY command was omitted from the WHATSNEW, but is documented<br/>
below.<br/><br/>

Global Channels:             You may or may not be wondering what a Global<br/>
                             Channel is. When you join a Global Channel<br/>
                             (1-32767), any message sent on that channel will<br/>
                             be displayed to everyone on the channel wherever<br/>
                             they are on the BBS (the exceptions are if a<br/>
                             member of the channel is in a Door or<br/>
                             transferring files, in which case the messages<br/>
                             will be displayed when the door is exited, or the<br/>
                             transfer complete). Global Messages are sent via<br/>
                             the /MSG command while in a chat room.<br/><br/>

  Chapter 20-B: Predefined Actions (ACTIONS.LST)<br/>
 ------------------------<br/><br/>
        The Teleconferencing Action File is a file named ACTIONS.LST in your<br/>
DATA directory which will have pre-defined actions like the "/a" command, but<br/>
without the "/a" use.<br/><br/>
  The format is:<br/><br/>
        [KEYWORD]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWN TO USER]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWN TO ALL BUT RECEIVER]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWS TO ALL IF THERE IS NO RECEIVER]<br/>
        [STRING SHOWN TO RECEIVER]<br/><br/>
  The 2 MCI codes that are for this file only are %S and %R, which stand for<br/>
  Sender and Receiver, respectively.  A sample file:<br/><br/>
       -----------<br/>
       kick<br/>
       ...  and the kick is good!<br/>
       %S just kicked %R square in the butt!<br/>
       %S is kicking blindly!<br/>
       %S just kicked you square in the butt!<br/>
       laugh<br/>
       Hahahahahahahahhahah!!!<br/>
       %S is laughing at %R!<br/>
       %S just burst out laughing!<br/>
       %S is pointing at you and laughing!<br/>
       punch<br/>
       Ouch!  That's smarts!<br/>
       %S just punched %R right in the face!<br/>
       %S is punching blindly!<br/>
       %S just punched you right in the face!<br/>
       -----------<br/><br/>
  If you enter "kick slammin" for example, %S is replaced with your handle,<br/>
  and %R is replaced with "slammin".<br/><br/>
  ---------------------------<br/>
  Chapter 20-C: External Programs through Teleconference<br/>
  ---------------------------<br/><br/>
       Teleconference now allows users to execute external programs via<br/>
       a special type of action format.  The first part of the action is<br/>
       an ":EXECx PROGRAM", where x is the drop file type and PROGRAM<br/>
       is the name of the program or batch file to run.<br/><br/>
       Sample format:<br/>
       -----------<br/>
       TW<br/>
       :EXECG TW.BAT<br/>
BLANK-><br/>
       %S|15 is going to play TradeWars!<br/>
BLANK-><br/><br/>
       It is imperitive that you leave in necessary blanks!<br/><br/><br/>
